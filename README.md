# nypl-menus

The New York Public Library has compiled a database of menu items dating back to the 1840s (http://menus.nypl.org/). The goal of this project is to develop an automated approach for identifying and categorizing seafood dishes. The resulting categorization will be used to understand the change in seafood diversity and sourcing over time within this menu collection. Students working on this project will build off of an initial training dataset to apply machine learning techniques for identifying and categorizing menu items.

dish-timeseries
This folder contains the code for evaluating temporal patterns in seafood dishes based on key words. There is a placeholder script "initial_script.R" that was added just to push the folder up. Feel free to delete when you add code.

data
All raw data is located here. The file is too big to put on Github, so please add the file I send to a folder called "data" within your cloned project folder.

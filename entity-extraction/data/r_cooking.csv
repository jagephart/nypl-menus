The bite sized fritters are extremely crisp and if done right, they're packed full of flavour. Apart from being vegan, they're also incredibly cheap to cook and so they make for a great filling meal on a budget. It's my opinion that falafel made with fava beans are better than the more common chickpea falafel ([Photo proof here](https://imgur.com/a/NzlQGMs)), and it may just be the original ingredient historically used in falafel. It's a matter of contention that can cause rifts between Egyptians (Fava falafel) and Levantines (Chickpea falafel), however [competitions](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/04/the-falafel-battle-which-country-cooks-it-best) and [critics](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190715-does-egypt-have-the-best-falafel-in-the-world) have confirmed this [over](https://pulses.org/updates/488-winner-of-london-falafel-festival-competition-recounts-event) and [over](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/en-espanol/sdhoy-egypt-wins-inaugural-london-falafel-festival-2016may04-story.html) again.

## What is Falafel and how is Taameya different

If you've not had falafel before; they're deep fried fritters that are [usually made from ground chickpeas](https://zaatarandzaytoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-21-at-17.46.46.jpg). This Middle Eastern food is as synonymous with the region, as Pasta is to Italy, and it's become one of the most popular vegan foods in the world. Traditional falafel is made with lots of fresh herbs and onions, which give them a bright green colour as well as a fresh and herby flavour. For the most part falafel is considered a breakfast or lunch food, and most people in Egypt (and the Levant region) will eat [falafel sandwiches](https://imgur.com/qgFhLfT) at least 2-3 times a week. The popularity comes down to a few factors, the flavour, it's price and how filling it is. Firstly it's extremely cheap to make falafel, and while you might get charged $7-10 for a [good falafel sandwich](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sFqzHGi3qqWyysQx6EYDZSy1KY=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13689423/Zooba_4.jpg) (about £8 in the UK), they usually cost about 10c or less in the Middle East and you can probably make 40 pieces for less than $5 ($1 in the Middle East). Secondly, they are packed full of flavour, all the herbs and onions give them a fresh taste, while the addition of coriander, garlic and cumin give them the perfect amount of spice. Finally they're a nutritionally dense food which help keep you full, you've got a decent amount of fibre and protein, but also quite a lot of macro-nutrients and let's not forget the fat from their frying.

Egyptian falafel (or as it's called in most of Egypt, Taameya) is a bit different from the falafel you're probably used to, as nearly all falafel sold in Europe and the US is Levantine falafel. The main difference is that it is made with [split fava (broad) beans](https://foratasteofpersia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSCF5930-scaled.jpg) rather than chickpeas (garbanzo beans) and this has a significant impact on the texture of the falafel. If you've ever tried to cook chickpea falafel yourself, you'll know that when the chickpeas are ground they develop a [super fine chopped texture](https://www.seriouseats.com/images/2016/03/20160323-falafel-recipe-01-composite.jpg) that almost resembles bulgur. It can sometimes have a hard time binding together which can lead to them falling apart when you fry them. To get around that, many people add binders such as flour or eggs to their falafel, but that has the negative effect of making the centre of the falafel dense and stodgy. Fava beans on the other hand [turn into a paste](https://imgur.com/bvtCkf1) when you process them. Rather than having very finely minced chickpeas as the base of your falafel, the fava beans are already bound together and so they are able to hold their shape naturally. The fava bean batter also ends up wetter than the chickpea batter, this causes more steam to evaporate when frying which gives it an airy texture. The traditional way of making Taameya involves grinding the beans in a mechanical pestle and mortar, [which also has the added effect of whipping air into the batter](https://youtu.be/c_AU4Sc_fMQ?t=185). To emulate this you can use the beater attachment on a stand mixer, which will [incorporate even more air](https://imgur.com/N7mx3En) and you'll end up with falafel that are light enough to float when frying (they'll still be great if you dont do this).

Apart from the texture, Egyptian falafel also tastes different from Levantine falafel. In Egyptian falafel, Kurrat (a species of wild leek native to Egypt) is used in place of the onion, and it imparts a leek like flavour with sweet and mellowed onion notes. To replicate that flavour, a combination of Spring Onions and leeks work really well. In terms of herbs, the batter also needs fresh coriander, parsley and garlic, then it's seasoned with Ground Coriander, Cumin, and Chilli powder. As opposed to the [ball shape](https://imgur.com/tGgWzEu) of most falafel, Taameya is usually shaped into a [hockey puck](https://imgur.com/op2g5nS), and the exterior is coated with sesame and coriander seeds. This shape means you get more crispy surface area but it also allows the insides to cook quicker (they also fit better in sandwiches). Of course this can still be made into the classic ball shape, and the great thing about this batter is that you can just [use an ice cream scoop](https://imgur.com/fnAhQnb) without manually shaping to get your falafel in the hot oil.

There's a few other types of falafel that we make in Egypt, but the one I think you should know about is stuffed Taameya. These are filled with a spicy onion filling that is made by sweating onions with Harissa and Tomato paste. When placed in a sandwich, they have that perfect spicy balance that you'd usually try to get by adding hot sauce. We also make a Taameya omelette that we call Egga, this is just Taameya batter mixed with a few eggs before frying. It has a strong herby flavour in comparison to a regular omelette and it's a good way to use up any leftover batter. The best way to serve Taameya is in a sandwich. These are typically made with a flatbread similar to pitta, and are accompanied by a tahini sauce and a simple salad. We usually eat this with salty turnip, carrot and cauliflower pickles called [Torshy](https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000628636335-wiqf3p-t500x500.jpg) (Torsu in Turkish), or some pickled fried aubergine. 

## Cultural Context

There are a lot of theories about where and how Falafel or Taameya originated, and it's a very charged topic with most countries in the Middle East claiming to have invented it. The truth is no one really knows where falafel originated but it's very likely that it has an [Egyptian Origin](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/falafel). Many Egyptians will say that falafel is a Pharaonic food and that the consumption of fava beans was common place in ancient Egypt, however the practice of deep frying falafel would have been difficult without refined oils. Another favourite theory is that it was first eaten by Coptic Christians as a meat alternative during their fasts, but there isn't any evidence to back this up. The most likely theory is that was invented during the British Occupation of Egypt as the first recipe for falafel appears around this time. One historian claims it may have been inspired by the Indian dish parippu vada, which is like a falafel but made with green peas. This theory holds a lot of weight with me, particularly because the British occupation of Egypt also lead to the creation of [Koshari](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ik05j7/koshari_is_an_egyptian_dish_that_exemplifies_the/), which itself was an Egyptianization of the Indian dish Kichidi. 

The theory goes that as falafel spread outwards from Egypt, the ingredients that were used also changed based on their availability. The chickpea replaced fava beans in the levant and the spices changed with it. If you're wondering why you've never heard of fava bean falafel, it's probably because nearly all Middle Eastern restaurants in the US and Europe feature a Lebanese menu.

## Flavour Profile
This recipe will make Taameya with a herby and fresh flavour that is way beyond anything you could buy premade. The Coriander, parsley, spring onions and leeks all merge together to give the falafel a bright and strong herb flavour with notes of sweetness from the leeks. The cumin and Ground coriander give it that background heat flavour (not spicy) and if your Ground Coriander is very fresh, it will also give a tart citrussy background flavour. You'll also notice this in the topping which coats the exterior of the Taameya, and combined the sesame seeds it adds some crunch.

In terms of texture, the Taameya is very light and fluffy. The interior will be airy and a bright green colour, whereas the exterior will be crisp and dry making for a satisfying bite. Adding them into a sandwich with some Tahini sauce, and a tomato and cucumber salad turns them into a sensational meal. I'd recommend using fresh homemade pitta bread for the sandwich and making a tahini sauce with lemon and garlic.

## Ingredients:

### Taameya Batter
* 400g Split Skinless Fava beans. You need the [bag on the left](https://foratasteofpersia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSCF5930-scaled.jpg) not on the right. The left has the skins removed and if you make this with the skins the recipe WILL NOT work
* 100g Spring Onions  
* 100g Leeks  
* 50g Coriander leaves
* 50g Parsley  
* 4 Cloves of garlic  
* 2 Tsp Ground Coriander  
* 1 Tsp Cumin  
* 1 Tsp Cayenne  
* 2.5 Tsp salt  
* 1l (1 quart) vegetable oil for frying  

### Harissa Filling
* 1 Medium Brown Onion  
* 1.5 Tbsp of Harissa  
* 1.5 Tbsp of Red Pepper or tomato paste  
* 1 Tbsp of Olive Oil  
* 1/4 Tsp Cumin  
* 1/4 Tsp salt  
* 1/4 Tsp Pepper  
* 1/4 Tsp Ground Coriander  

### Topping
* 1/4 Cup Coriander seeds  
* 1/4 Cup Sesame  

## Directions: 

I highly recommend watching the video for more precise directions and because there are some techniques for shaping that can only be explained visually https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY

### To make the falafel batter:
1. Wash your split fava beans thoroughly with cold water, then place in a bowl and cover with a large amount of water. Allow them to soak for a minimum of 8 hours until doubled in size  
2. Once doubled in size, drain the fava beans and set them aside  
3. Wash your leeks, spring onions, coriander and parsley, then roughly chop them up to a managable size for your food processor. Use the white part of the leek and while of the spring onion
4. Add all of the greens to your food processor and add the beans on top (The weight of the beans will help force the herbs into the blade, and it's a lot quicker than putting the herbs on top of the beans)  
5. Process everything until a finely minced paste forms (about 2-3 minutes), making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times. Once it looks homogenous and fairly well minced add the salt and spices  
6. Continue processing together thoroughly until well combined then set aside  

### To make the stuffing:
1. Chop your onion into a small dice, then place in a pot over medium heat with 1 tbsp of olive oil  
2. Saute for about 5 minutes until the onions start to soften then add the Harissa, Red Pepper paste and the seasonings  
3. Add a small amount of water to form a sauce, then allow it to cook down and thicken (about 15 minutes of cooking time)  
4. Repeat adding water and allowing the topping to reduce until the onions and sauce are cooked through  

### To make the falafel topping:
1. Using a pestle and mortar, lightly crush the Coriander seeds till you can smell their aroma. You should split most of the seeds in half but you don't want to grind them into a powder  
2. Combine the coriander seeds with the sesame and it's ready to use  

### To whip up the batter:

Add about a quarter of the batter to a stand mixer, and whisk it with your paddle attachement on medium speed for about 5 minutes. When it is light and fluffy it's ready to be used. Use the whipped mixture immediately as it will deflate quickly. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer, or the whisk attachment on your food processor. A blender may also work and manually whisking it might help. If you can't do this step at all, you can add a 1/4 tsp of baking soda to each cup and a half of batter and whisk it in. That will help fluff it up slightly  

### To shape the falafel:
1. Wet the palm of your hand or a piece of parchment paper, very lightly  
2. Place about 2-3 Tbsp (or 1 ice cream scoop) of Batter on the paper/your hand then lightly flatten it using your other hand. Apply very little pressure as you don't want this to end up very thin  
3. Wet your second hand and press it into the topping, then lightly press the topping to the batter so it sticks  
4. Flip your Ta'ameya onto your second hand or another piece of parchment paper then apply the topping to this side as well  
5. Fry the ta'ameya within 5 minutes of shaping otherwise it will deflate
NOTE: If you are doing this on your hand directly, you'll have to put them in the oil straight away. This can be a bit dangerous as you'll need to get your hand very close to the oil, but if you're comfortable, this technique works amazing. See [the video](youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY) for the visual technique.

### To shape the falafel the easy way:
1. Using an ice cream scoop, fill the scoop with batter, then scrape off any excess  
2. You can dip the top of the scoop into the seeds or you can add them to the scoop before filling it  
3. Release the falafel directly into the oil  

### To stuff the falafel:
1. Repeat steps 1-2 from ""To shape the falafel"", using about 2/3rds of the batter amount  
2. Place about a teaspoon of filling in the centre of the batter and flatten it out  
3. Add the remaining 1/3rd of batter on top then join the two sides together  
4. Add the topping to both sides or leave plain to differentiate it  

### To fry the falafel:
1. Heat your oil to 160c or 320f, then add your falafel in  (I'd recommend using an oil thermometer here, too hot will undercook the falafel and too low will allow it to absorb more oil)  
2. Once in, baste the top immediately with hot oil so it solidifies. I'd recommend using a spoon to splash them with oil and this prevents the falafel from deforming or falling apart  
3. Fry the falafel for 2-3 minutes on the first side  
4. Flip over once browned underneath then fry for another 2-3 minutes  
5. When that time is up, fry it for 2 more minutes on each side  
6. Remove from the oil with a spider and drain, before placing it on a paper towel lined tray to dry for a few minutes  
7. Serve within 5 minutes and enjoy  

### To make a fantastic falafel sandwich
1. Make homemade pita, store bought is crap and this falafel deserves better  
2. Make a simple Egyptian salad, with roughly chopped cucumber, tomato, spring onion, parsley and season with lemon juice, olive oil and white vinegar  
3. Make a tahini sauce according to this [recipe](https://youtu.be/Y7r9HAcR2RQ)  
4. Split open your pitta bread, and spread in a layer of the tahini sauce  
5. Add a couple tablespoons of salad to the bread, and some optional salty pickles  
6. Add a couple of falafel pucks to the bread and enjoy  

## Notes
* Iraqi falafel is made with a blend of chickpeas and fava beans, you could replace half the fava beans with chickpeas here if you'd like to  
* Substituting the fava beans with chickpeas will still produce a nice tasting falafel, but you'll have to work harder to keep it together

&gt;  
&gt;let's cook an epic meal on the slo'!

Sound about right? Today, I have for you fine people, a recipe to raise your serotonin level and satiate your hunger for a warm and comforting Sunday evening meal.

Gyuvetsch (гювеч; pronounced gue-vetsch) is a traditional Balkan dish, originating from Turkey and made with some variations in Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Romania. In essence, it's a stew prepared in earthenware pots. These pots are, confusingly, also called gyuvetsch. They come in two varieties -- small pots containing a single portion, and large ones sufficient to bathe comfortably newborn twins.

We'll use the big G this time; get the largest one you can fit in your oven and can lift when full. The smaller ones are good for.. well, if you like this, I'll share a recipe later.

This is a small variation of my mother's recipe from Bulgaria, with some minor embellishments for improved palatal experience. Traditionally, it's made with whatever vegetables are seasonably available, but in this day and age, almost everything is. Feel free to omit the veggies you don't like or have on hand, and add some your favourites. This is a dish intended to have every vegetable available tossed in, and the taste will become even richer and more complex the more (complementary) ingredients you add.

This is one of those epic dishes that is that it's even better the next day. So even if your hungry squad can't quite gobble everything up in one go, the leftovers are still very good for a few more days.

Fair warning, this takes some time to cook, but prep time is short; after the pot is in the oven, it needs only occasional tending to. I usually get started just after lunch to have it ready and still warm by the evening.

# Bulgarian Gyuvetsch

Prep time: 30 minutes

Cooking: 2-3 hours

Resting: 3+ hours

Pairs well with full-bodied red wines (malbec, merlot, mavrud or local varietals from your region)

# Ingredients

The absolutely must-haves are carrots, onions, potatoes, aubergine and peppers. Meat is optional; substitute with your favourite protein source instead (red kidney beans will probably work great). Other veggie suggestions: okra, green beans, peas.

Canned versions of vegetables, particularly home-made, are also possible (I actually like it better that way; my mother makes a canned stew mixture with aubergine, peppers and tomatoes that works great here).

Given the nature of the dish, proportions to be considered very loose. Make sure your ingredients will fill the pot nicely almost up to the brim (I feel that I need to say this, being reminded of that one time when there was too much stuff, and not enough pot to put it in. No, I don't want to talk about it. Yes, it turned out fine in the end).

* Carrots, 2-3 medium-sized, chopped
* Onions, 2 medium-sized, chopped
* Veal or pork shoulder, 600 g, cut in large pieces
* Aubergine (eggplant), 1 medium-sized
* Zucchini, 1 medium-sized
* Parsnip, half of medium-sized root
* Celeriac (the root): a good chunk, say 5x5x1.5 cm \[2x2x1/2 in\]
* Red pepper, 1-2 medium-sized.
* Canned tomatoes, 2 cans (\~650 g)
* Potatoes, peeled and chopped, 700 g
* Sugar or honey, 1.5 tablespoons
* Sunflower oil
* Black pepper
* Paprika
* Salt
* Parsley, finely chopped

Also three bottles of wine (this is for the COOK, not for the dish).

# Preparation

* If using aubergine, peel and cut in advance, and immerse in salty water for 30 minutes. This is to take away some of its bitterness.
* Open the bottle of wine and pour in your favourite glass. Pluck out the earthenware from the nether regions of your kitchen and place it near your work surface.
* Pour some sunflower oil on the bottom, just enough to cover it. Sip some wine.
* Arrange the vegetables in layers. Sip wine between layers as necessary.
   * Carrots, celeriac, parsnip and other root vegetables (except potatoes)
   * Meat
   * Potatoes
   * Fresh vegetables (zucchinis, peppers, aubergine)
   * Tomatoes (remove skins, squeeze by hand if whole)
   * Honey/sugar on top (if using). It masks some of the acidity of most tomato-based recipes, and I find it improves the taste. Feel free to skip it.
* Pour generously some more oil on top. Sip again, for the last time.
* Pour some water until it fills around half of the pot. This dish is flavoruful enough; keep your veggie stock for another occasion.
* Close with the lid and place in the oven (220 degrees Celsuius). As this is earthenware, do not place in hot oven, as it may crack.
* Aaaand prep work is done! Sip some wine - you deserve it, you beautiful/handsome cook, you!
* Let it stew for an hour with lid closed. Don't mess with the oven and don't open it, it's doing JUST FINE. Concentrate on your wine instead, and break out another bottle.
* Open the pot and stir carefully everything. It should be boiling by now. Add salt, pepper and paprika.
* Close with the lid and place again in the oven. Steady as she goes, if you are feeling tipsy already.
* After another hour, check progress again. Taste carrots and meat to determine readiness; if necessary, return for 30 more minutes. It will seem to have more water than necessary; don't worry about it, sip some wine.
* Chop up the parsley, and mix in the pot. Turn off the heat completely when you think it's ready, and LEAVE IT IN THE OVEN WITH THE LID ON. Can't stress this enough, really. This will help everything soak up the excess water, and it will become soft and tender, even the meat. Trust me on this.
* I TOLD YOU NOT TO MESS WITH IT. DID YOU MESS WITH IT? NO? GOOD! HAVE SOME WINE.
* Let it sit in the oven until ready to serve. Serve warm with the third bottle of wine.
* Accept graciously compliments on the dish from your table companions. Pretend your blush is from compliments and definitely not from the wine.

Pepper

**Directions:**

Chop the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic.

Slice the mushrooms.

Turn on the Saute function on the instant pot. Add the olive oil and saute the onion and garlic until softened, about 1 minute. Stir in the mushrooms and cook for about 3 minutes. Add a pinch of salt to help them release water. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until mushrooms are tender and the liquid evaporates.

Stir in the carrots, celery, thyme, tomato paste, smoked paprika, and balsamic vinegar. Add salt to taste.

Add the wine, diced tomatoes, and vegetable stock. Set Instant Pot on high pressure, and then set the timer to 8 minutes. Once cook time is complete, do a quick release. Remove the lid and switch the Instant Pot to saute on the high setting and let the sauce simmer for 5-8 minutes to allow it to reduce.

I love Asian food like Korean, Japanese, and Thai! I'll leave a Korean recipe with you today.

&lt;Kimchi Pork Stew&gt;  


\[Ingredients\]

Must have- 200g Pork shoulder (or belly/loin)- 400g of Kimchi (normally this is one pack and you can get it from Chinese/Korean shops)- 1 Spring Onion- 1/2 Onion- 1 clove of garlic- pepper- chilli powder 3T- soy sauce 2T- water

Extra (If you want to add more)- Sugar 1T- 1/2 Tofu

\[Recipe\]

1. Dice Pork shoulder/belly (if you can't find it loin works too) and sprinkle peper over it.
2. Put the diced pork in a pot and start roasting. Don't cook it fully. This is just to bring out the fat and oil from the meat.
3. When the pork is white and there are some fat on the bottom of your pot, pour water. Make sure the water is like 1 to 2cm above the meat. (depending on the size of your pot)
4. Boil the water
5. When it boils, put Kimchi in it. If your Kimchi is not pre-chopped, chop your kimchi beforehand. one piece of Kimchi may as long as your thumb (length wise)
6. When it boils (or keeps boiling) put chopped onion.
7. Crush a clove of garlic and chop the spring onion thinly. And throw them in the pot as well.
8. Add chilli powder 3T and soy sauce 2T. Soy sauce can be less than 2T.-&gt; Boil and serve (if you want to finish here)
9. If you like a slight sweetness, add sugar 1T. It wouldn't be too noticeable but completes the harmony between saltiness and sweetness.
10. Finally, slice the Tofu and put into the pot. Close the lid and let it ""simmer"" a little.-&gt; Serve

5 cups organic old fashioned oats (not quick cook!)
1 cup raw almonds
1 cup raw cashews
1/2 cup flax seeds
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tbs pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon (optional)

1/3 cup real maple syrup
1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup coconut oil, microwaved so liquid
2 tbs real vanilla extract

Do a course chop on the nuts or run through a food processor and combine all dry ingredients. Combine wet ingredients with a whisk (make sure the coconut oil is warm enough to maintain liquid status when added to mixture). Add wet to dry and mix. You may need to add some dry to the bowl of wet just to get the last of it left in the bowl. 

Spread out granola on 1/2 sheet pan lined with a silicone mat or parchment and press down with a weight or back of a big spoon until it’s really dense and flat.

Bake at 325 F for 45 minutes. Once cooled a bit, break it up into pieces to finish cooling. Add dried fruit like golden raisins, dried cranberries or dried banana chips &amp; pineapple to the cooled granola mix and keep in an airtight container for up to a month. 

I love this with plain yogurt or milk. It also makes a lovely gift in a pretty jar with with a ribbon.

So I was watching Seaching For Italy with Stanley Tucci (don't judge, it's a beautiful looking show!) and in the episode on Sicily they mentioned a sauce called ""Garum"" that I had never heard of before.

They mentioned that the Romans put it on everything, like ketchup, so of course I had to try some. I'm a sap, I'll try anything once.

Both of these are on Amazon which is where I got them, I know some folks are sensitive about Amazon links so I googled you some alternates.

I found a version made in Spain:

https://www.culinarycollective.com/new-matiz-flor-de-garum-premium-fish-sauce/

""Anchovies, Sea Salt, Spices""

That's it. The flavor is fish sauce umami so if you're used to Asian fish sauces, it won't be totally alien.

I like the note on the side of the box:

""Thanks to a residue analysis from garum produced in a factory in Pompeii and entombed in 79 A.D. after the eruption of Vesuvius, along with a study of a recipe from the third century A.D. found in a European abbey, we were able to create a rigorously authentic and delicate garum sauce. Add to salad dressings, sauces or pasta dishes to add a distinctly savory umami flavor.""

Tried a little tonight and it's super salty (80mg/tablespoon or 14g), so adjust your salts as needed. A little goes a long way and at $35/100ml it better! 10 calories per 14g. 2g carbs. &lt;1g sugar.

While I was researching this sauce, I found another I was unfamiliar with called ""Saba"".

https://www.acetaialeonardi.it/aceto-e-condimenti-balsamici/scopri-la-linea-classico/saba-mosto-cotto/l201-saba-mosto-cotto-250ml.html

Ingredients: acetified cooked grape must. Contains sulphites.

Processed cooking down grape must, it's what you get if you try to make balsamic vinegar without the fermentation. Taste is sweet, grapey, raisiny, pruney kind of flavor. 

Where garum pairs with anything savory, saba goes with anything sweet. Fruit, ice cream, but also cheese and a variety of meats.

60 calories per tablespoon (15ml). 5mg sodium, so hardly any salt compared to garum. 15g of carbs, including 13g of sugars, so way, way, way sweeter. Probably why it's called ""the honey of grapes"".",Cooking,Secret Weapon Sauces:,44.0,0.89

We all know someone in our lives that doesnt like mushrooms. For me, it's my older sister. Many a night I would sit through dinner watching her pick the lovingly cooked mushrooms out of pastas, curries, risottos, and pies I made for her. I asked her what she didnt like about them, and she told me it was the texture. My sister has moved out to go to college, and during quarantine I've had the perfect chance at mushroom redemption. 

I actually came across this fabulous fungi on a whim, going through the produce section of the grocery store, I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to delve into the wild world of mushrooms. Usually people just grab the usual brown mushrooms, cremini mushrooms, white mushrooms, the usual, but something caught my eye. *Baby King Oyster Mushrooms*. I took a chance on them, and I was rewarded heavily.

My usual way of roasting mushrooms is to cut them up into even slices, onto a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, neutral oil of choice, kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper, into a preheated 425 degrees Farenheit oven for 16-20 minutes. With brown mushrooms, it made them delicious, but with baby kings it made them *sing.* 

They have a woodier, meatier texture, much less squishy than their brown and white counterparts. The entire mushroom is good to eat, and they have an absolutely gorgeous, lightly sweet, tender savoriness that is brought out perfectly by roasting with just salt and pepper and oil. It gets crisp in the oven in a way that subverts the sogginess one would find in a pan, and has made even the most vehement mushroom hater in my life, eat a full bowl of risotto, leaving not one mushroom on the plate.  
So from me to you, I humbly present to you the baby king oyster mushroom, for all of us with picky eaters to feed.

If you are frustrated by your green onions or chives constantly flowering, or looking for the best permaculture onion ever, may I suggest a much much better alternative: the [Egyptian walking onion](https://www.rareseeds.com/store/vegetables/onions/egyptian-walking-onion)

This perennial is by far my most favorite edible food I have ever planted. It sends up a green shoot in early spring that you can use just like spring onions, scallions, or chives. It has a lovely light onion flavor. The stem is hollow but sturdy, so it holds up great for chopping. You can slice it thin and use it as a garnish, or slice it into large chunks for stir-fry, or anywhere in between that you would use a spring onion, scallion, or chives. Once a year in the early fall, the shoot will form a small cluster of bulbs at the top that look and taste just like shallots, and you can use them as such. If you don’t want your walking onions to propagate, you can chop the cluster off and the plant will keep making shoots. If you do want propagation, the bulbs will get so heavy the stalk will fall over, and then the bulbs root themselves and make a new plant. So the onion “walks” across your yard!

To coin a phrase, “we put this #%$+ on everything.” Baked potatoes instead of chives, all Asian dishes instead of scallions (like lo mein, fried rice, potstickers, and egg foo young), as a garish on anything really. They are delicious, bug and deer resistant, and easy to grow. Our patch is 6 years old and growing strong. They green up here in the east coast of the US in early spring, ours came up about two weeks ago, they will remain green and edible through a few light frosts, for us probably all the way until early November.

Hi  


I am a 19 year old gastronomy student, i have been training and studying on my for about four years, and plan on becoming a cook. Recently i have been thinking on how to express complex ideas through culinary, if it is possible to take a certain vision of the world (from any kind of thinker) and translate to a dish or series of dishes.  


I will try to summarize the concept that gave me the idea. Brazil has a huge territory, with very different climates, economic situations and ethnic groups, so, a few centuries ago, when it was being populated, one of the main questions was "" How to we make such a diverse group of people feel like they all belong to this nation, how do we make tem feel like a family?"". One of the answers, by the Brazilian thinker Alberto Torres, established that such bonds would be the result of the exploration of the territory. Essentially, the people of Brazil would come to recognize themselves as Brazilians through the endeavor that was settling the land. The ideia itself is of course much deeper and not one i fully agree with, i just presented enough so i could talk about how i think it can be expressed through cooking. The way i imagined the composition of the dish is as follows: a base, representing the territory (probably yucca, the national ingredient of Brazil), with smaller elements distributed on top, each representing the main Brazilian ethnic groups (Portuguese, west Africans and Natives) and a sauce covering such elements to indicated their ""integration"" or ""oneness"". Naturally the ingredient chosen to represent the Natives would be of Native origin, and the one for the Portuguese and west African as well. Now, this ideia is simply an example of how i think it is possible to convey ideas through cooking, in no way i am stuck to Brazil or even sociology and history. This ideia is also simple, i believe the concept can be pushed further. Anyway, just wanted to share that and see if anyone would like to expand on it or give a different perspective : )",Cooking,"From Brazil, looking to debating some ideas of mine",0.0,0.5

This combination makes following a recipe very difficult. I either don't have the ingredient or can't eat it, by the end I'm normally left with a meal lacking nutrition. The only way  for me to cook healthy meals is to make it up.

Until recently I have always had tapioca flour around but I never knew when to use it. I was cooking mushroom sauce which was too watery, I googled thickeners and tapioca starch came up. Just a small spoonful turned my watery mush to the perfect sauce. 

It has minimal flavor andonly a small amount can have a huge impact on the texture. Unsurprisingly it worked great for making a vegan gravy. Nevertheless it's just a starch, a common thinking I gradient that I'm sure better cooks use often.

Where I have been blown away is using it in stir fries. It is common for people to use peanut butter to give a noodle stir fry a bit more weight. I don't like adding peanut butter because I find it removes all the flavor. This is where tapioca flour comes in: 
Add whatever spices you want
Add plenty of water
After the spices have soaked in much of the water will have already evaporated
Finally, just add a bit of tapioca flour and any last ingredients

As a TL;DR for the article, it's basically just some author who thinks that preparing lunch at home is causing so much stress and burnout for people. Accounts of people spending hours upon hours preparing special lunch dates at the beginning of the pandemic, and inevitably burning out on cooking. Or saying things like ""These days, if Curtis even remembers to eat lunch, her choice is guided by what’s fast and will produce the fewest number of dishes to wash."" as if being conscious of dishes is somehow an indication that your lunch is sad?

I saw this pop up on my recommended articles and to give my honest opinion, I thought it was one of the most ridiculous articles I've read in a while but I want to see if maybe I'm just the odd one out here. I know a lot of people here have a particular interest in cooking which might bias against this, but even putting that aside I just cannot fathom the mindset of a person that writes this article.

For my daily routine pre-pandemic, I had to either prep my lunch the day before or the morning of work, and usually it was the quickest and easiest cold lunch I could slap together, like a lunchmeat sandwich with some chips.

Since the pandemic started, I make my lunch everyday when 1pm rolls around. I don't go fancy and take hours upon hours like some of the anecdotes in the article claim they do. I take 20 minutes to make a quick and easy lunch, often utilizing leftovers, and it's almost ALWAYS better than anything I would have brought to work in a tupperware container. At minimum it's better just for the fact that I can eat it hot, and it takes very little extra effort.

I can't help but think this author is just some pretentious rich person who normally gets takeout for lunch literally every single day at work and is wildly out of touch with the reality that normal people still had to prepare their lunches regardless of the pandemic.

When I first met him, and cooked a meal for him for the first time, I cooked a curry recipe that I was confident with and just chopped the onions ridiculously small so they was undetectable thinking he was just being fussy and pathetic refusing to eat onions 😂 The next day I naturally learned he suffered badly with IBS. I felt so bad and apologised loads but both saw the funny side!

He always says that we can eat separate things but we’ve been together nearly 9 years and I just prefer us to cook the same meal and eat together and obviously have no problem adapting to his dietary requirements (of course I’ll eat his restricted foods on a meal we’re not cooking together/sharing or somethings I can cook and add to my plate separately eg mushrooms).

Well, not just asking, casually hinting at it multiple times a day over the last few weeks. The reason he loves them so much is because its the first course he would ALWAYS get at our local Argentinian steak restaurant which went out of business a few years ago.

I've been looking at recipes online but all of them use different types of dough and filling, you might as well just call them ""dumplings"" because there's so many variations of them just like dumplings.

His only preferences, when I asked him, would be ""meaty"" and ""goes well with garlic sauce"". This barely gives me any direction so I was hoping you guys would have some great recipes that fit this description. Since he's so fond of the empanadas from this Argentinian restaurant, I guess something authentically Argentinian would work?

Also he may have said he prefers the very meaty type but I've served him calzone type dishes without meat before and told him they were vegan afterwards and he was amazed they didn't contain meat or animal products at all, so vegan or vegetarian recipes are welcome too!

I'm willing to make the dough myself or get store-bought but the only dough sold here is puff pastry, savoury pie dough, filo pastry and croissant dough. I won't have access to any pre-made dough other than those.

I am now mildly freaking about about fish slicing, mostly because I don't wanna do just rolls.  I got a piece of tuna belly delivered just now that contains the fattiest otoro I have seen in my life, and I want to do it justice.

So my questions are:

* Do I need to do anything to prep the fish in advance?  Any seasonings or anything?

* Are there good videos on how to slice the fish?  I have salmon, hamachi, and tuna, as well as the toro, and need some nice slow detailed videos on how to slice it for sashimi or nigiri, or for rolls.

* How is the best way to break down my tuna belly?  It is mostly a square piece about 2 inches by 2 inches, with about 1 inch being super fatty otoro and then transitioning into chutoro.  Should I slice the piece to do separate otoro and chutoro blocks for producing nigiri/sashimi?  Or slice vertically to produce blocks which are half otoro half chutoro. I can take a photo if it helps.

Obviously I am not gonna become a sushi chef instantly, and this is something people train for years to do, but I do wanna do my best and respect the really nice fish I just got, and make a delicious night with our friends.",Cooking,Resources for preparing sushi at home?,0.0,0.5

Hello.

I am making a mousse cake, and one of the layers is white chocalate passion fruit mousse. I simmer the white chocolate and passion fruit paste with half of the heavy cream, cool it and then whip it with the other half. The problem is that I found out that because of the white chocolate the mousse is much more runnier than dark chocolate mousse done this way, and it's good for eating in a cup but to runny for a cake. I am a bit tramutised from the last time I used gelatin, but I do have glucose syrup, so my question is could I use glucose syrup to thicken the mousse? And would adding constarch help? I am now at the cooling stage of the mousse ( before wipping with more cream ) and can't make a new one, so I need something that I can add to the whole thing, or a small amount of chocolate/water/cream or something else.

The easiest ever: pinch of yum's miracle no knead recipe. Mix it, let is sit overnight, bake it, done. Dead simple. So I adapted it. Here's the recipe and my favorite variations because, guys, I'm seeing way too many sad self pity posts and making this will fix all of that.

3 cups flour (measure by fluffing then scooping, so it's not too dense and becomes uniform).
1.5 cups water
1.5 tsp salt
0.5 tsp instant yeast.

Note: any flour works, all produce different results, ap makes the fluffiest, rye the flavoriest, whole wheat the holiest. Wholiest. Shut up.

Mix the dry ingredients. Variation one: mix in dried green herbs (oregano, thyme, sage) until it smells very nice. Variation two (my favorite) everything bagel seasoning. Add what seems like too much then a little more.

Mix in the water, it'll seem too wet and shaggy, it's not. Stop thinking about adding more flour. Put. Down. The. Bag.

Cover it, let it sit out on the counter for twelve to 18 hours. Wake up, pee, drink coffee, remember you have bread to bake, wash your damn hands, heathen, preheat the oven to 450 with a dutch oven in it (or a ceramic covered dish), scoop the shaggy mess dough out onto parchment paper or floured surface and make it into kind of a ball. Cover it again, wait for the oven to hear up then wait 10 minutes more then bake it covered in the dutch oven for 30 minutes and uncovered for 10 - 15 and let it cool on a wire rack.

Then I turn the heat down to 0.8 and put a lid on it.(0.7 is the lowest heat where the rice will still boil when the lid is on). So, i let the rice boil on low heat for 15 minutes and then turn off the heat and let it sit for another 10 minutes. So far this method has worked all the time.

* I am the person who eats full meal whereas my partner is a grazer. She will eat a small serving of whatever is cooked and she will then have some chips or snacks. Now, that ""small serving"" can become a ""full serving"" without notice.
* We usually plan what we want to cook for the week; however, as mentioned, there is a chance she will change her mind. Sometimes, she just wants take out; others, she will want chicken instead of fish. Which won't be an issue if we shift one day but, in the case of meats such as fish, that is an issue. Or, if whatever she wants is something that requires a bit of prep work (think defrosting or purchasing some specific ingredients). The worst case scenario has been she does not understand the work required for a dish and believes it is easy. Think braised ribs can be done in under an hour. 
* To further complicate things, my in-laws, at times, bring some of their home cooked dishes. I appreciate this but they don't usually tell us ahead of time and just show up.

* If you have a spouse and/or children, how do you plan your meals?
* Based on the details above, any suggestions you can provide?

Hi, I see loads of posts on here with people asking how to use up leftover roast chicken (a problem I’m not really familiar with, I’ve got to say, because in my view cold roast chicken sandwiches are about as good as it gets...) and I wanted to share this dish I cobbled together - a sort of cross between a chicken pot pie and chicken hot pot.

This is my favourite way to cook - using what’s on hand, making it up as I go along, adapting it each time. However you do it, I promise it’s delicious (and recently has been getting better reviews than the actual roast dinner which takes like 3 times as long to cook!)

I fry off some vegetables - always leeks, often mushrooms, maybe chuck in some finely diced carrot, today I added frozen peas, a clove of garlic, and a handful of spinach - and set aside. Then I make a simple white sauce. Combine with the veggies, add your chopped up leftover roast chicken, put in a baking dish and top with thinly sliced potatoes. Brush with oil, season, and bake at 200°C for around 45 mins. That’s literally it. Looks so impressive, but so comforting and simple!

I'm a knowledgeable cook and I'm usually pretty consistent in making delicious food, whether it's for myself or for a crowd, but everything I cook lately comes out tasting bad - too much salt, bland, over-cooked, fat not rendered enough, overly spicy, it's always something.

I recently found that I have high cholesterol and have made some changes to my diet. I still eat some of my favorite things in moderation, but it's been a lot of whole grains, chicken, fish, beans, greens, fruits, vegetables, etc. and I just can't seem to enjoy the food as much.

I think one of a few things is happening:

1) Maybe ""healthy"" food is just never going to taste as good as ""unhealthy"" food. White rice is just better than brown rice. Pulled pork is just better than chicken breast. Pork bacon and turkey bacon aren't even remotely the same thing. Maybe I just need to accept this as part of a healthier lifestyle?

2) I'm missing the little things. The extra drizzle of olive oil, the pat of butter, the fresh grated parmesan, the mayonnaise, all the little additions that make a dish better. It makes such a difference in the eating experience, but it adds up so fast in terms of calories, fat, etc.

3) I'm becoming a little obsessed with calorie counting and trying to lose weight and it's a shitty headspace to be in all the time. I'm not obese or anything, but a year+ of Covid lockdown has resulted in an unhealthy lifestyle and I have put on some weight. You're probably thinking ""just don't count calories and eat what you want and you'll feel better"", but that's what got me here in the first place.

I've had people who hate coffee beg me to make more of it. in italy it's a precise point of honour to be able to make it ""just like my mom's/ granny's!"". the secret it's that it's stupid easy to make, you just need to be a bit careful with the egg whites. also, it's best to make it the day before and leave it in the fridge overnight- this way it will become firm and will hold the shape instead of collapsing into a sad (very delicious, but also sad) mess. 

you'll need: 

* 4 eggs (either super fresh or pasteurised. make sure of this, because the tiramisù won't be cooked.) 
* 500gr mascarpone cheese 
* 80gr sugar (recipes usually start from 100gr, but believe me, it's a lot. this dessert is so rich already that more than that would actually be nauseous... incidentally, I've seen a pastry chef make the mascarpone cream with a base of custard. madness)
* 1 pack of savoiardi (also known as ladyfingers) cookies. here in italy, usually packs are ""tiramisù batch"" sized- we're talking about 3-400grams. 
* about 8 moka pots of coffee, unsweetened. you can add a splash of marsala if you so desire (I personally dont like it)
* bitter cocoa powder

process: 

prepare the coffee and pour it into a deep dish or bowl, then set it to cool. you don't want to dip your fingers in boiling hot coffee.

separate the egg whites from the reds. with an egg beater, beat the reds with the sugar until they get light in colour and fluffy. add the mascarpone cheese, and beat it into a soft, smooth cream (incidentally, this makes an excellent sweet sauce to eat with pandoro and panettone at christmas). rinse the whisks of the egg beater, then proceed to beat the egg whites untill to a very firm snow- careful not to overbeat them. mix the egg whites into the mascarpone cream, folding it gently with a spatula. 

now you are ready to assemble your lasagna of sin. take one savoiardo at a time, and dip it quickly in the coffee before setting it on the bottom of the tub, creating a layer of cookies. break cookies in half to fill any gaps. slather a nice and thick layer of mascarpone cream, then another layer of cookies dipped in coffee, and so on until you have exhausted all your ingredients (last layer must be cream).

A few of mine:

\- Paste and pasta are both called “pasta” in Dutch, so imagine me looking for tomato paste for the first time… (turns out it’s just literally called “tomatenconcentraat” – concentrated tomato)

\- We use the word “paprika” for both the spice and bell peppers. And yes, I can admit I thought recipes wanted me to grate bell peppers or something…

\- I don’t actually think we have a word for squash. We call it pompoen (pumpkin) and a butternut squash is a “flespompoen” (bottle pumpkin). Granted, that one wasnt that hard to figure out cause of the shape, but still. By this logic a zucchini is a pumpkin as well.

\- Also we call white button mushrooms “champignons”, which is just the French word for mushroom. As if there’s no other mushrooms (thank god there is).

And sort of related, there’s something I still haven’t figured out. The chili that we call “spanish pepper” here.

I was looking into books that could help me figure it out. There seem to be two main components that I need to master. Techniques and flavors (flavours from my UK friends).

* [Ratio](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3931154-ratio) by Michael Ruhlman
* One of the many Technique books by Jacques Pepin (pick your year/edition there are so many)

* [The Flavor Bible](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4443485-the-flavor-bible) by Karen Page
* [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753841-salt-fat-acid-heat) by Samin Nosrat

Ingredients

* 3-5 pounds chicken breasts or thighs
* 2 cups plain yogurt
* 5 tablespoons Ginger-Garlic Paste
* 3/4 cup lemon juice
* ¼ cup kosher salt
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 3 tablespoons toasted ground cumin
* 3 tablespoons toasted paprika
* 2 tablespoon toasted ground coriander seed
* 2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 tablespoon kashmiri chili powder
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 2 large onion, thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, roughly mashed
* 1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 2-3 tablespoons honey
* 1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves

Instructions

Slice the chicken into bite sized chunks. Place in a large bowl.

Combine cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside 3 tablespoons of spice mixture. 

Combine remaining 6 tablespoons spice mixture, 3 tablespoons ginger garlic paste, yogurt, 1/2 cup lemon juice, and 1/4 cup salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Pour marinade all over chicken pieces, using hands to coat every surface. Cover loosely and refrigerate. Allow to marinate for at least 4 hours and up to 8.

TO COOK UNDER THE BROILER: Line a broiler pan with heavy duty aluminum foil and preheat the broiler to high with the rack set 6 inches below broiler element. Place raised cooling rack. Broil until charred and blackened on surface, about 8 minutes (chicken will not be completely cooked through—this is ok).

Heat ghee in a large Dutch Oven. Add onions, and caramelize on low heat for 30-40 minutes.

Add remaining 6 tablespoons ginger garlic paste, cook until fragrant, and then add tomato paste. Cook mixture, stirring frequently, until dark and beginning to char in spots, about 10 minutes. 

Add reserved spice mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and half of cilantro, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan with a spoon. Simmer for 15 minutes, then puree using a hand blender or by transferring to a tabletop blender in batches.

Stir in cream, remaining quarter cup lemon juice, honey, and fenugreek leaves. Season to taste with salt, then set aside until chicken is cooked.

Transfer chicken chunks to pot of sauce. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes.",Cooking,Wondering if I should make any modifications to my existing Chicken Tikka Masala recipe,3.0,0.72

Personally, I enjoy Indian cuisine a lot. Much of Indian cooking requires pressure cooking, which generally turns the food into a mush. Although the flavors are extravagant, the texture can sometimes be off-putting or make the experience less enjoyable. To combat this, a universal garnish is cilantro. It brings freshness as well as a needed crunch to the dish. You can put it in dal (a type of lentil soup) to bring some freshness to the dish, or on any appetizers like chaat or samosas. My personal favorite is to garnish a dosa with it. It cuts through some of the extra oil/spice that might be in the dosa and always bring a bite of fresh taste.

I'd love to read some of your thoughts.

Now I have a brand new world of flavors, textures, cuisines, and techniques to explore. It’s been wonderfully exciting; I can cook Korean food for my boyfriend that’s just like his mom’s, I can cook chicken, pork, and beef (limited cuts, but got the basic ones down), and I just sauteed spinach for the first time a week ago. I’m learning, and I love it.

Something I’ve started to LOVE doing is experiment on my own. Oftentimes I’ll put a different twist on a recipe I already know just to see how it turns out, but sometimes I just go free and do whatever. 

I’ve had two successes from this; I saw a picture of a breakfast hash on r/food, so I tried making one with no recipe. It turned out so delicious that I make it every Sunday now. I also made a real sandwich with more than just American cheese or PB and J— it’s garlic herb chicken breast, provolone, spinach, and hot sauce toasted on sourdough, and it’s lunch for me for 3-5 days out of the week. It’s so good!

But most other times, experimenting with food with no recipe makes me question why I was born. Two of my worst were...

- White sauce: used flour to thicken it up faster, turned out being a milk and parmesan concoction with clumps of flour in every bite. Added garlic and onion *toward the end*, so there was no shortage of raw chunks ruining the texture and overpowering the flavor. I could probably try this again because it was sauce-like without the flour, just needed more time and I was too impatient, and I couldve added the garlic and onion sooner or cooked them preemptively to get the texture and flavors to mix together better.
 
- Spicy “roasted” sweet potatoes: boiled the sweet potatoes 3/4 of the way to soften them, some way less cooked than others because I didn’t cut them all evenly enough, don’t have an oven currently to actually roast them in so I tried crisping them up (frying them?) with oil in a big pot, wouldn’t crisp up because I couldn’t press enough water out, added corn starch thinking they could crisp up, just ended up with bits of fried gummy corn starch everywhere, sweet potatoes were just oily. The seasoning was PERFECT, but it couldn’t save the dish. This one just happened today.

I try to stick with techniques I understand rather than going in completely blind, but trial and error seems to mostly end with errors. I guess it’s not really trial and error though, since I get too scared to try making them again. Anyone have any advice?

Thanks!

Getting straight to the point, here's the recipe and a [song](https://youtu.be/zQbQABKiJ_8) to listen to while you're making it. Much of what is listed is really up to you. Bear in mind the ***Main concept is that the Oats are going to absorb the grease/oil***. This recipe has a lot of freedom to it depending on your portions:

**Tools**:  
\-A Wok, A pan, a pot, or something to stir fry the food with.  
\- A Large Mixing Spoon you use to cook with.

**Ingredients**:  
\- Ground meat (Beef or Pork is best, I haven't experimented with cutting actual meats- but if you decide on that be sure to add extra oil for the Oats to absorb)  
\- Complimentary Vegetable (for myself I usually buy frozen precut vegetables for convenience)- Rolled Oats (not much to say, they're rolled oats)  
\- Salt  
\- Black Pepper  
\- (**Optional**) Oyster Sauce, Yum-Yum Sauce, or a sauce you like! (since the oats will have a strong flavor, you might want to cover it with a sauce!)  
\- (**Optional**) Garlic (powder or diced), any other seasoning you find desirable.

**How-to:**  
**-** As a child when I cook I was taught, ""Meat, Veggies, and Carbs"" so similarly first ***fully*** cook the meat at a Medium-high heat.You're going to want to season your meat with Salt, Black Pepper, and any optional seasonings you would like.  
\- Next throw in your vegetables.  
\- Then lastly throw in about 2-3 handfuls of your Rolled Oats (try 2 first, if it doesn't look like alot throw in one more handful). If you're using the Ground Beef/Pork there will generally be enough grease for the oats to absorb.  
\- Stir well for 5-10 minutes (or however long you feel so long as it doesn't burn), and *voilà!*  
\- Place your food in a bowl/plate and add your optional sauce (if you wanted it) and enjoy!

* Roasted chicken 
* Fried chicken

Hey y’all, i bought a dirt cheap CharBroil 190 tabletop propane grill for my apartment balcony and camping, going to the lake, etc. I have a question about a small air gap hole that is next to the regulator. 

I’m planning on buying a hose regulator adaptor for a 20lb tank so i don’t have to worry about refilling the little ones as well as getting some lava rocks for heat distribution and retention 

Anyhow, it got me thinking about potentially closing up that little hole next to the regulator. 

I feel like i’m probably asking a dumb question, but if i plug it up could i get better fuel efficiency or increased BTUs? 

My thinking is that it’s probably there for air flow or to prevent the flame from working its way back into the regulator. 

Don’t want to blow myself up. 

TL;DR can i plug the hole next to the regulator on my tabletop propane grill?",Cooking,Tabletop grill question please help!!,0.0,0.5

Over the past couple of years I've seen people try to up the starchiness of the water by reducing it, by reusing water from a previous batch, or by using bronze cut pasta, but my favourite technique comes from [this](https://youtu.be/259MXuK62gU) video by Ethan Chlebowski, citing food science by Harold McGee and J. Kenji Lopéz-Alt. They pour just enough cold water to submerge the pasta, salt it conservatively, bring it up to a boil, drain a little bit of water, and then add the sauce ingredients. 

I've taken it a step further where I add even less water and then cover it with a lid to trap some steam, taking it off to stir intermittently until very little water remains. Then I sauce it up. It keeps every bit of starch in the pot and saves on dishes. Sure, if I'm making carbonara or something, I'll have to use a pan to fry the pork in anyway, but if I'm just making a simple emulsified pasta like buttered noodles or cacio e pepe, which I frequently do for lunch, then all I need is a pot, a lid and a wooden spoon.

So I have been making my own bone broth for a little over a year now and I've experimented quite a bit with different kinds of bones, roasting, and base liquids.

It takes a long time and is a bit vague but I love treating myself to a long cook when I have the time and energy. I'm not a professional and if you have a better recipe or some tips, I'd love to hear them (but be respectful because I'm a softie with a little blueberry heart and Crohn's disease - hence the garlic shortage).

I make this in three parts usually spread over two days. The parts are:

1. A hearty red sauce of some kind
2. the noodles
3. the cheese sauce

I make them all depending on what is in season/on special at the store and it’s not particularly rigid, but here is approximately what I threw on the floor yesterday.

Red sauce

Ingredients:

\-500g pork/veal mince

\-three onions

\-one clove of garlic (if you love garlic, go ham though)

\-diced carrots (about 300g)

\-3 sticks diced celery

\-500ml passata (tomato puree)

\-3 tbsp tomato paste

\-about 3 cups of stock

\-extra aromatics that you like: I used bay leaves, oregano and a LITTLE cinnamon, and salt and pepper

Method:

\-caramelise onions in butter on low heat until sweet (this takes a really long time but can totally be skipped)

\-add in celery and carrots and cook for a few minutes on medium

\-chuck in tomato paste and garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring

\-add meat and cook off

\-throw in the passata and stir it through

\-add plenty of stock

\-cook it down until it’s nice and thick - I usually read and book next to the stove and stir occasionally over an hour or so. I’d recommend a cosy mystery.

\-add some salt and pepper to taste (I use a little MSG here as well)

\-set aside (this is the one I tend to do the day before because it tastes much better reheated - a nice option is making a double batch, eating some on spaghetti one night and in lasagne the next)

Noodles

Ingredients:

\-a good fine flour (just plain works too if it’s all you have)

\-eggs

Method:

\-you will need about one egg and 100g flour per person - whatever leftover pasta dough you have can be frozen or just cooked up while you’re waiting for the lasagne to bake (yum)

\-dump the flour into a big mixing bowl and make a well in the centre

\-crack the eggs into the well

\-whisk the eggs gently, slowly incorporating the flour as you go

\-when it becomes infuriating, wash your hands with soap and then get in there and mix with your hands

\-knead the dough with the gusto of a passionate Italian housewife (if you think you need more flour or a splash of water, be very conservative, but remember climate change is real)

\-the dough is done when you stretch it out and it springs back (if it’s really tiring, let the dough rest for 20 minutes covered and then come back and keep kneading)

\-roll out the dough nice and thin and in the shape of lasagna sheets (I use a pasta roller but an empty wine bottle or rolling pin will work fine)

\-keep the lasagne sheets separated by a good powder of flour or you will have to roll it out again

Cheese sauce

Ingredients:

\-2 tbsp butter

\-1 tbsp flour

\-400ml milk

\-as much of your favourite cheese as you think is allowed (I used about 1.5 cups of grated salty dutch cheese)

Method:

\-melt the butter in a little saucepan

\-add the flour and stir, cooking off on medium heat to burst the starch granules (cause raw flour tastes like butt)

\-add the milk and heat until it’s good and steamy but not boiling

\-slowly add the cheese a little at a time, stirring until it’s all melted in

\-set aside

Assembly

\-heat your oven to around 175-180 degrees celsius, probably about 80000F, I’m not sure

\-grab your favourite dish and start layering!

\-I start with about two tbsp of cheese sauce, then a good slock of red sauce, then cover with pasta and repeat

\-make sure not to end on a pasta layer or the crunch of weird baked, dry pasta will make you sad

\-bake with some foil for about 30 minutes

\-take the foil off and add some nice salty grated cheese on top, then bake a further 15 minutes - try to use the middle of the oven because if it’s at the top, the cheese will go dark brown and dry out

\-take out of the oven and (I cannot stress this enough) LET IT SIT FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES, or it will slop onto the plate and sit sadly staring at you. If you’re worried it won’t be hot enough, still wait, then plate, then stick in the microwave.

Final tips

\-I usually only use the meat on special occasions, and it’s quite nice when swapped out with finely chopped vegetables like broccoli, mushrooms or cauliflower, because they soak up the sauce

\-Meat replacements are also lovely, I’ve tried crumbled tofu, fake mince and soy blocks and it’s all nice.

\-cheese-wise I would choose for a salty over a mild - I know ricotta is a lot of people’s jam but the graininess in lasagna really takes me out of the experience

\-mise-en-scene helps me with long recipes. I put on some nice music, an apron and my best Italian-nonna persona and romance myself into the cooking

\-Do not drop your lasagna. No matter how many internet points it gets you, it’s a waste of food and a terrible tragedy.

 I find myself not having enough time to cook everyday and resort to food deliveries. However, I’ve come to learn to prep my ingredients in advance for the week (chopping frozen veggies, blended onions etc) to cut down on actual cooking time.

That works all fine and dandy until we get into  deep fried, flour coated food. I recently tried to prep some chicken for popcorn chicken, marinading it in egg, spices and using premix flour as the dry batter. I tried cooking some straight away and it tastes amazing, so I finished up prepping the rest and putting them in a ziploc bag into the freezer. But before the individual pieces had any chance of freezing, their coating just sort of fused with each other within the bag forming one big thick batter of bits of chicken. Definitely not what I had in mind.

I’m trying to go for something like frozen popcorn chicken that you’d get in the supermarket, the ones that already has hardened coating. How would I go about achieving that? I’m considering flash frying but IMO it kind of takes away from the convenience of prepping my ingredients, as I have to essentially cook it twice now.

1. Boil water

3. Put Potato in boiling water.
4. Prep Steak, season with salt, pepper, &amp; garlic powder then cook with olive oil + butter + thyme.
5. Once the Steak is good, I set it aside to rest. 
6. About the time the steak is good the potato should be done. Drain potato, mash, add a knob of butter (I don't like too much butter I use more olive oil instead to improve the texture), and olive oil. Combine and then add the chives.

Here’s what I do.

First I heat a cast-iron pan over the stove and let it cool a bit while I prep. 

So some people like to spatchcock while others like to eat the tailbone. I prefer spatchcocking in part because of the faster cooking and jucier breasts but mostly because it lets you spread the seasoning more evenly.  

I like using both fresh and roasted garlic. Chop it quite finely and then set aside. 

I prefer using oil rather than butter. The oil from your roasted garlic works best. (You can prepare your own garlic oil by sautéing garlic in it at the lowest heat till it starts getting golden, but IMO, the difference in flavor isn’t worth the effort, so just use olive oil if you don’t have any). Keep it in a bowl. Now, take like half an orange (or unsweetened orange juice) and squeeze two tablespoons of it over your oil. Add your garlic to it, and whisk (the garlic helps emulsify it). Use about 2/3rds of it on the chicken. Don’t just pour it, use a brush. Rub some under the skin too. 

I salt the chicken liberally, add freshly cracked black pepper, some thyme, tarragon and rosemary. I also like to add sumac, allspice and (very little) cardamom but try not to overpower the more basic flavors. Don’t add more than 1/8 tsp of each spices for a 2kg bird. 

Now, I slice a few Spanish onions thickly, mix it with sprigs of the herbs, the orange-oil-garlic mixture and salt and pepper. Then I put the chicken on the pan and tuck the onions around it without overcrowding the pan. 

Then I just cook @240 degrees Celsius till the thigh is cooked through (use a thermometer). The time really depends on the size of the chicken. 

I prefer not to baste it so as to leave the skin crispy. My oven hasn’t been working all that well so I broil it for ten or so minutes too but only do that if your chicken hasn’t browned and crisped up. 

Then, I take it out, cover the chicken in foil and let it rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, I take the sprigs of herbs out of the onions and transfer the pan to the stove. Deglaze with white wine and chicken stock (if you don’t have any, you can boil the chicken backbone (plus giblets if you have any) and aromatics in water while the chicken cooks), reduce, then spoon it onto the chicken.",Cooking,My go-to roast chicken,11.0,0.75

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrgw8XYYYWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrgw8XYYYWo)

When seeking to master a dish, I'll usually read as many recipes as possible, try and determine which ones will have the most impactful and delicious flavor, and then wing the entire thing keeping in mind the ingredient ratios that seem most likely to be tasty. 

When I see the profound quantity of dry spices, salt, garlic, and ginger used in this video, it immediately became apparent that all my previous attempts had underwhelmed due to being too diluted (too much broth liquid in comparison to the spices and herbs meant to flavor it).

It's silly to me to see these recipes online calling for however many teaspoons of turmeric and garam masala as its become apparent that these quantities are more in line with what I would use for a picky 18th century queen. 

So far this video is the only resource I've found that's left me thinking, ""OK, now if I do something along these lines, maybe I could actually achieve the deeply impactful and delicious flavors on offer at my local Pakistani joint"", although the instructions in the description seem completely detatched from what's happening in the video.

The method I employed was to poach the apples in a heavy mushroom stock made with dried mushrooms and apple cider, then strain apple before caramelising them lightly.

The resulting sauce was too sweet because of the cider (I ended up having to balance it out with a touch of vinegar) and truth be told, the combination of the fruits and the savoriness of mushrooms wasn't unpleasant, but just not as good together. The lesson here is that it is better to make a mushroom reduction to serve with the roast pork, and to have caramelised apple pieces on the side (or even a potato/apple mash would have been better and easier to do).

Ingredients

Four large, ripe avocados
⅓ tablespoon olive oil
High-quality hot sauce, two drops (or to taste)
Red wine vinegar, two drops OR lemon juice, two drops (or to taste)
Pinch salt
Onion juice, two drops (or to taste)Garlic juice, two drops (or to taste)

Directions
Scoop the flesh out of three and a half of avocados, add the olive oil and mash it up smooth. (The best way is to start with a potato masher or ricer, and finish with a stout wire whisk.) The last half-avocado, which should be the firmest one, is cut into half-inch cubes, for texture.

Add the salt and the drops of the liquid ingredients. The exact amount depends on the quality and exact flavor of the avocados, your own tastes, your family and guest’ tastes, the chips you will serve your guacamole on on and the quality and strength of the liquid ingredients themselves. Taste, adjust and taste again. Stir in the cubes. 

Don’t prepare guacamole too far in advance of serving it. The olive oil and acids you used will delay oxidation, but if guacamole waits too long to be eaten, it will ruin brown. I recommend  serving good guacamole on tomato slices, as guacamole salad, or on top of low-sodium chips  without extra flavoring.

Note:  Avocados have a very delicate flavor. Ideally, guacamole should enhance it, but all too often the ingredients added to the avocados obliterate their natural taste. This is especially likely to happen if your use the Big Three No-Nos: sour cream, yogurt and mayonnaise. Once upon a time, avocados were pricey. It made sense (in a twisted way) to stretch them with filler. Now, however, you can get avocados for $.70 to a dollar, so it NEVER makes sense to use filler. Your guacamole should be 97% avocado and nothing else.

Wait, Garlic and Onion JUICES?  What kind of madness is this? I will now initiate your into one of the most carefully kept secrets of elite restaurant chefs. Did you ever wonder how they get the tastes of garlic and onions into sauces and cream soups that are absolutely smooth — with no texture of anything solid at all, no matter how finely it’s minced?

You can sometimes find garlic and onion juices at a luxury grocer’s, but that isn’t always possible. Fortunately, Amazon carries both products at reasonable prices. Once you’ve bought few bottles, you’ll find a jillion uses for them, in things like marinade, gravy and such diverse delicacies as cheese grits and cheese spreads.

It's time to try to reconcile, and I'd like my kiddos to grow up with the idea that this is a ""normal"" thing to eat, if possible.

I do almost all the cooking in the house. I'm probably slightly above average for a home cook, skill-wise, but not a culinary rockstar.

Or, she tells you estimates, but it never quite tastes right when you make it because her estimates were inaccurate? Besides recording a video of her methods and carefully observing the subtleties of her technique (for which there is no substitute), what can be done to save her recipes for posterity?

Here's how you can capture the exact amount of each ingredient she uses:

Weigh each of the ingredients she will be using and record the initial weights. Then you can just let her cook from memory. When she's done, weigh each ingredient again and record the final weights. Subtract the final weights from the initial weights to get the exact quantities she used. (I recommend weighing in grams; ounces are too large a measure for measuring things like spices.) **EDIT:** For spices, you may need a drug scale that can weigh fractions of a gram. **/EDIT**

**EDIT:** Keep in mind, ingredient quantities, by themselves, do not constitute a recipe. A lot of recipes require that you engage all your perception and make adjustments based on how wet or dry something is, the texture and firmness of various doughs, or how much something has cooked! This weighing trick is primarily useful for capturing seasoning blends of spices and sauces, which can be tricky to reproduce. **/EDIT**

To convert weights into volumes, you can do that separately after grandma is finished by weighing out those items and seeing how many teaspoons or cups each one amounts to, but at least you have the exact quantities recorded once you've captured the weight of each ingredient.

To reduce certain recipes down to ratios, you can then divide all of the weights by the smallest weight in the list, or perhaps check if you can multiply the numbers to get nice whole number ratios.

This method is also very useful when you are experimenting and adjusting the amounts of ingredients for a sauce or a spice blend by taste, and want to capture the exact amounts you used when your adjustments are just right. Few things are as frustrating as making a perfectly balanced sauce only to not be able to reproduce it because you can't remember how much of each ingredient you used.",Cooking,Extracting the exact quantity of each ingredient from grandma's recipes even though she cooks from memory and never measures anything,1709.0,0.97

 Thinking about whether to vacuum seal my food. For example, I have a ~$120 worth of a piece of uncut/untrimmed ribeye from the supermarket that I intend to use 90% for hotpot (where I would need to slice them thinly and separate them into 2-4 servings per portion), defrosting a portion when ready to consume and leaving the rest in the freezer. I know that you should also avoid re-freezing something that's been de-thawed.

* How long can I expect the ribeye to last without noticeable degradation in quality in the freezer? I guess it is properly ""vacuum-sealed"" by the supermarket but I do see a pool of blood so it might not be sealed in good condition?

* How long might a portion of thinly sliced beef last in the freezer? I tend to use those plastic produce bags to put the portion of sliced beef in, squeeze out as much air as possible, and tie a tight knot and put in the freezer. I suppose I could use freezer Ziploc bags instead, but I'm curious if it's a worthwhile solution. Are we talking 1-2 months, 6 months, or maybe a year max?

* Thinking about actual vacuum sealing if it is indeed significantly better for storing meats several months at a time. I'm skeptical FoodSaver is much better than the options above because I also looked into chamber vacuum sealers and it seems the latter is better in every regard (including the strength of the vacuum seal) except with regards to the nitial investment of an expensive sealer). I feel like FoodSaver is just popular because it is cheap, accessible, and easy to use. If I am going this route, I'm thinking of going all in and getting a chamber vacuum seal with a budget of $1,000 as I really don't like the expensive plastic that the FoodSaver requires (no ideal about the quality of the third-party offerings but regardless, a FoodSaver isn't meant to last for many years). However, I have the opportunity to get the FoodSaver rolls at a heavily discounted rate so I'm not count it out. I just feel a chamber vacuum sealer might be a smarter investment in the long-term if it is considered BIFL (replaceable parts available if necessary) as opposed to replacing FoodSavers every few years (along with the fact that plastics for a chamber vacuum sealer is many times cheaper than for a FoodSaver).

In Moroccan culture, a plate of couscous is a gift, a physical expression of support and this shows in the weekly Friday couscous Moroccan women would prepare for the men coming back from a long midday prayer at the mosque, sharing with neighbours, family, and nearby working labourers.

The couscous I’m about the share a recipe for is \*the\* couscous. While many variations exist, the 7 vegetable couscous associated with the Chaouia region (around Casablanca), Morocco’s breadbasket, is what springs in mind first when hearing the word “couscous”.

This meal is not immensely complex but rather labour-intensive. If you have a couple of hours to fill, this would be a rewarding use of them.

**Things to know and misc. tips**

Picking the right kind: if it’s in a carton box, put it back. If it says something about boiling the couscous on the packaging, put it back. If the words “Israeli” “instant” “pearl” “pre cooked” or “toasted” appear anywhere, put it back.

In all seriousness, you need to look for durum wheat semolina (but not semolina \*flour\*) either medium or fine works (it’s very important that the package mentions which kind it is), but I’d say fine is typically Moroccan.

Dari and Tria are the most common brands in Morocco if you can find them online. If you’re in Canada, Zinda or Cedar are acceptable.

You need something to steam the semolina above the stew. A keskas/couscoussier is ideal, but in the very likely case you don’t have one, I think a steam basket can do the trick. Just mask sure it doesn’t come in contact with the broth underneath.

Smen is unfortunately a critical flavour to have in your couscous. I do not recommend to skip it but I’m aware no one is gonna leave butter in a jar to go rancid for a year to make one dish, so I’m glad to announce your average cultured butter is not too bad of a substitute.

What you can skip however, is ras-el-hanout. We’re talking minimum 25+ spices to make any halfway decent mix (the one I use has over 40). I do not recommend trying to make your own because it is gonna cost you a serious chunk of cash and you’ll end up with more ras-el-hanout than you’ll ever realistically need, so if you otherwise only have access to the stripped down commercial mixes that are some variation of ginger/turmeric/paprika, just skip it or use a pinch of nutmeg instead.

Without further ado, the recipe. For 8 people, because you’re meant to share:

&amp;#x200B;

**INGREDIENTS**

&amp;#x200B;

Vegetables:

* 2 yellow onions, diced
* 2 Roma tomatoes, diced
* 1 large turnip, peeled and cut into 1-inch thick pieces
* 3-4 carrots, cut into 2-inch long pieces
* Red squash: kabocha is the closest but anything, including pumpkin, could work. I used about half a small butternut, cut into the same size as the turnip.
* 4-5 zucchini, green or white (or both), cut into 4 or 6, same size as the carrots
* Half a small head of cabbage (\~1lb), roughly chopped in 1-inch chunks
* 2 cups of pre-soaked chickpeas. If you must use canned, they need to be added in much later.
* A whole bouquet of cilantro, tied.

Spices:

* 1 tablespoon each of ground ginger, turmeric, and pepper.
* 1/2 tablespoon each of ground cinnamon (or 1 stick) and ras el hanout.
* 1.5 tablespoons each of dried parsley and paprika.
* A pinch (\~2 dozen strands) of saffron (optional) soaked in a cup of warm water
* Salt to taste.

Choice of meat: 3 lbs, bone-in, cut into large chunks, either of:

* Beef/veal: chuck, short rib, plate.
* Mutton/lamb: shoulder, rump, leg.
* Chicken: whole, quartered, as country as you can. Soak in acid and salt for at least 30min, then wash, before use.

I like hard chicken, which requires an extra hour of stewing.

Couscous:

* 2lbs durum semolina
* 2 tablespoons smen
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Warm water

**STEPS**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Cover the bottom of the pot in olive oil. Heat up to medium-high, then add in the onions.
2. Once the onions are soft and starting to brown, add in the tomatoes, occasionally stirring until it becomes a paste.
3. Add in all the spice, salt, and the (saffron) water.
4. When the mixture is back to a paste-like consistency, add in the protein, and cover all side with the sauce. Cook for 3-5 minutes.
5. Add two cups of water, reduce the heat and, cover and let the meat simmer for 30-45minutes or until half done.
6. Prepare the couscous for the 1st steaming round: mix the couscous with warm water (about 1/2 cup) until sticky (DO NOT wet too much), add in salt and olive oil, rub between your fingers to get rid of any clump, and layer evenly in the steamer.
7. When the meat is half cooked, add in the turnips, carrots, and cilantro into the pot and add enough water to cover. When the pot is back to boiling, put the steamer on the pot and the lid on the steamer and cook for 20 minutes.
8. Take the couscous off the pot and empty the basket into a large plate to cool off the couscous for a couple of minutes. Wet your hands with water and rub the couscous between your fingers and palms to get rid of clumps. If it’s too dry, add some more warm water. This should take about 10 minutes.
9. Add the cabbage and chickpeas into the pot and cover with water. Once it’s back to boil, put the couscous back into the steamer and on the pot. Cover and let cook for another 20minutes.
10. Repeat the process of declumping the couscous, use more water if needed.
11. Add the winter squash into the pot and cover with water. Once boiling again, ladle two cups of broth into a separate saucepan.
12. Put the couscous back in the steamer and let steam for 25 minutes.
13. In the meantime, put the zucchini in the saucepan with the broth and cook separately on medium heat until tender. Strain and put the broth back into the big pot.
14. The couscous is ready when it’s soft and fluffy, but dry. The grains should have increased slightly in volume. Take off the pot and let cool, then rub in the smen and some olive oil. Salt if needed.
15. Check the vegetables and meat for doneness. If ready, turn off the heat.

&amp;#x200B;

**SERVING**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Layer a bed of couscous.
2. Pick up the meat with tongs and arrange in the middle on top of the couscous.
3. Add the vegetables around and on top of the meat to cover it all.
4. Pour the broth on the middle and around, but let the edges of the couscous dry. Pour some broth into a bowl and serve alongside the plate.
5. Serve with a cup of buttermilk.",Cooking,"On Fridays, we make couscous",84.0,0.88

So I'm cooking my favourite dish I enjoy making (and eating), chilli.  I found that the few times I've instead of adding 2 tins of diced tomatoes, I've adding 1 ordinary diced tomatoes, and one with Italian herbs.. and it turned out really well.

And even then, if all you can afford are dollar store spices, that's ok, it still works, and really, it doesn't make thaaaat much of a difference. Add some acid and salt and you're good to go.

Edit: the snobbery of saying only food using fresh ground spices is good is what I'm taking issue with. Not everyone can afford a blender or coffee grinder, or even have the space for it.  Cooking should be accessible to Every One. And they shouldn't be shamed for not being able to.

Add in the flour, cocoa powder and chopped chocolate, and stir together with a spatula. Don’t forget to scrape the sides and bottoms of the bowl to ensure everything gets mixed in properly. Scrape the batter into the loaf pan.
Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out with a few moist crumbs. For a gooey brownie, stay on the 15 minute side….but for a crunchier outside, bake for the full 18 minutes. Remove from oven, immediately add flakey salt, and allow to cool on a cooling rack for 5-10 minutes before carefully removing from the pan using the parchment paper.

Unfortunately, he doesn’t really cook. I do, but I’ve never even thought about cooking on one of these. It’s basically just a dressed up frying pan? I’m not against it or anything, I just find it a bit baffling. Then again, he’s such a kind man, and he usually just lets me handle the kitchen, so I really want to make him something special. 

So, apart from some sort of korean BBQ and homestyle teppanyaki, what the actual fuck do I use it for? Seems my husband once ate grilled beef on some sort of hot rocks in Spain, and that’s where he got this idea.

I was thinking of doing a setup pretty close to chinese hotpot, since he absolutely loves chinese cuisine, but obviously with meat and vegetables cut for grilling instead of cooking. Then freestyling a couple of dips with chili oil, some chinese sesame paste, shacha sauce, soy etc.

I’m thinking of including these things: 

* sliced moose tenderloin (since we live above the polar circle, it’s cheaper and tastier than beef) 
* sliced chicken thigh fillets
* scallops
* baby bok choi
* fresh mushrooms
* spring onions
* sweet potatoes
* japanese eggplant
* bell peppers
* boscoff (french pink) onions
* napa cabbage

... and serve it over steamed rice. What do you think? Am I missing something obvious? Is there anything special I should think about? And do you have any other ideas? I really want him to feel that this was a good buy, and I’m very happy for any idea. I realise I could obviously cook anything on this little beast, but I have great cast iron and carbon steel pans for everyday use, so I’m looking for ideas where the tabletop setting would add to the experience - for normal steaks and such I’ll always prefer my normal pans to nonstick.",Cooking,Tabletop grill ideas,6.0,0.81

I made my kimchee following [this recipe](https://www.feastingathome.com/how-to-make-kimchi/) calling for gochujang pepper flakes this time, when in the past I've always used the paste. The result was a bit disappointing (to me). I thought I added plenty of pepper flakes since I like it spicy, and the bag smelled/tasted pretty fresh. I did accidentally add back some of the brine (I was on auto-pilot) and it may have diluted it. 

So my question is, since it's garlicky/salty/sour enough, how can I get it more spicy? Would it be OK to throw out some of the brine/juice and replace that or mix the brine with more salt/paste? I also didn't have any fish sauce because where I live it's a bit harder to find, so the kimchee is passable, but some complexity is missing. Is it OK to add after it's been fermented?

843,2021-03-18T08:49:22Z,0.0,m7q33k,t3,,109.0,"Dolma, Dolmades, Mahshi and Sarmi are all different names for stuffed vegetable dishes. Nearly every country in the Middle East and Balkans has their own version (or multiple) of Dolma, and although they may share origins, the recipes vary widely based on local tastes and ingredients. I think [Iraqi Dolma](https://imgur.com/a/XvJ2wTx) is the best of all Dolma recipes. Not only does the stuffing contain rice and meat, but it also has a tangy sweet and sour flavour, that is able to turn any regular vegetable into a spectacular meal.

## What is Iraqi Dolma
By definition Dolma is a family of stuffed vegetable dishes, some are served cold as an appetizer and others are served hot as a main dish. They are usually filled with rice or meat or a combination of the two, but other stuffings such as lentils and vegetables are also used in some countries. There's two distinct kinds of Dolma; those that are made by hollowing out vegetables such as Aubergines, Courgettes, Peppers and Tomatoes, and those that are made by rolling up leaves such as Grape vine leaves (I'll call them Vine leaves), Cabbage leaves  and Swiss chard. Every country cooks a different selection of these Dolma and they sometimes have a specific stuffing for each one.

Most stuffings will start with a base of rice, and in the Middle East crushed tomatoes are nearly always used in the stuffing. Finely chopped or grated onion as well as fresh parsley or coriander also make a common appearance in the stuffings. The spices that are used is where the Middle Eastern recipes diverge the most, in Egyptian Mahshi (Dolma) it's usually just Black Pepper and Bharat (or Middle Easter 7 spice), whereas in most Levantine Dolma, cinnamon and sumac are also used. Iraqi Dolma takes that a step further by adding in not one but three amazing tangy ingredients that give the Dolma its unique flavour.

The first one is a key component of many Iraqi dishes, [black limes or loomi](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/styles/im_landscape_100/public/2020-02/Black-lime_0.jpg?itok=_taVFVtQ). They're made by placing small limes in the sun to dehydrate and dry out, which just like sun dried tomatoes, results in a concentrated, developed and umami flavour. As opposed to fresh limes, they impart a lot less acid and a more well rounded flavour. These limes are used widely in Arabian Gulf cuisines and In Iran, where they are used to add a citrus and light acidic flavour to stews and rice dishes. There's also dried white limes which add a similar flavour to the black limes, the difference between them is usually how long they were left to sun dry.

The next ingredient that makes Iraqi dolma unique is [tamarind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarind). Tamarind is the fruit of a leguminous tree, and inside the pods is a sweet and sour tangy pulp. If you've wondered what gives a good pad thai its tanginess, it's probably the tamarind that you are tasting. It's also used quiet widely in Indian cuisine and in Egypt we make it into a tangy juice. For the dolma, the tamarind pulp is dissolved and turned into a sauce that is poured into the pot when cooking. That sauce also contains the third tangy ingredient which is [pomegranate molasses](https://youtu.be/MhzBMs6wQyU). This is a syrup that's made from pomegranate juice that is reduced and cooked down to a thick consistency. Pomegranate molasses adds a sweet and sour flavour to dishes, and it also has a notable fruity taste similar to a berry coulis.

I think the best way of making dolma is stuffing a wide variety of vegetables, and this is certainly the case with Iraqi Dolma. One type of dolma that is extremely memorable in this version is the stuffed onions. These are made by wrapping layers of onion around the rice filling, and as it cooks the onion softens and caramelizes. Combined with the tangy sauce that's added to the pot, these bite sized onion dolma are insanely delicious, I would happily make and eat a whole pot of just this kind. To take the recipe to the next level I would recommend adding some lamb chops to the bottom of the pot. They will get flavoured by the tangy sauce and there's nothing quite like a sticky tangy lamb chop.

## Cultural Context
The origins of dolma is a contentious topic. The name itself is derived from the Turkish word Dolmak which means to fill, and so in part it may seem like a Turkish or Ottoman invention. However some sources claim that it is in fact a Persian food from the 17th century, and others state it's an ancient Greek food that was eaten millenia ago. What is clear however is that the Ottoman Empire had a heavy hand in spreading dolma across it's empire. Balkan, Turkic, Middle Eastern and European countries that were under control of the ottomans nearly all consume Dolma in some form. Another interesting clue on the ottoman origins of modern dolma is the Swedish dish Kåldolmar. This is basically stuffed cabbage leaves, and it's thought that the recipe was brought to Sweden after King Karl XII was exiled to the Ottoman Empire for 5 years.

Of course the dish has evolved in each country where it's made with the locally available produce and the spices or seasonings common to the cuisine. In Egypt Mahshi (Egyptian Dolma) is usually made with Aubergines, Courgettes and Peppers. They're considered one of the classical Egyptian comfort foods and they have a different filling from that used in [Koronb (cabbage rolls)](https://i0.wp.com/www.damdomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B4%D9%89-%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A8.jpg?resize=719%2C531&amp;ssl=1) and [Warak enab (vine leaves)](https://kitchen.sayidaty.net/uploads/small/54/54607dc66fe5b9ac1e4a568ea5adaf95_w750_h750.jpg). In Iraq, Dolma is an everyday meal and while it might take hours to prepare, it wouldn't be uncommon to have this for a week night meal or two days in a row. 

## Flavour Profile
What sets Iraqi dolma apart from all the other dolmas is the tangy flavour profile it has. The tamarind, pomegranate molasses, and black lime work together to create a well rounded tangy flavour. There's the sourness of the black lime which is more mellow than fresh citrus. There's the sour tangy flavour of the tamarind, which I would liken to fizzy gummy cola sweets without the fizz. Finally there's the tangy of the pomegranate molasses which has a fruity tang similar to the tartness of some berries. Their flavour gets absorbed into the rice and glazes the exterior of the vegetables. Any sweetness the vegetables have, such as in the onions, peppers and tomatoes, is magnified further by the tangy sauce. Don't take this to mean that the dish is sweet, it just has a light sweetness to it.

The fresh herbs in the rice are still quite noticeable. If you get a piece of dolma which didn't get coated in the sauce, you'll find that the rice has a fresh herby flavour as well as a nice cinnamon after taste.Although there is meat in this stuffing, I don't think it plays a huge part in the flavour of this dolma and it could easily be replaced with lentils for a vegan version. It does however make for a better texture in the filling as it adds some contrast to the rice. Rather than describe the flavours of each different vegetable in the dolma, here's how I would rank them:
* Stuffed Onions
* Vine leaves
* Swiss Chard
* Aubergines
* Peppers
* Tomatoes
* Courgettes

You don't have to make every one of these in the Dolma. Some of them are harder to find such as the baby Aubergines and Courgettes, so you could always leave these ones out. I would however recommend getting a Jar of vine leaves as you could use up any excess stuffing in these.

## Ingredients

These are the vegetables I used for stuffing, you can use any combination of vegetables for this but I would recommend getting a jar of vine leaves or some swiss chard to use up any excess filling. You'll also need at least this many to vegetables for the stuffing or you will end up with a lot of leftovers. If you remove any of the below vegetables be sure to double one of the others in place of it.
* 10 small aubergines  
* 4 small dolma peppers or 2 bell peppers  
* 3 small tomatoes  
* 3 onions  
* 10-15 vine leaves  
* 5 swiss chard leaves  

### Filling:
* 250g Beef mince (can also use lamb)
* 75g Tamarind paste dissolved or 3 Tablespoon of tamarind concentrate in 1/2 c water. Half of this tamarind liquid will go in the filling and half will go in the sauce  
* 2 Onions  
* 3 Cloves garlic  
* 1 1/2 Cup Basmati rice  
* 1 Cup parsley  
* 1/2 Cup dill  
* 1/4 Cup pomegranate molasses  
* 3 Tbsp tomato paste  
* 2 Tbsp olive oil  
* 1 Tbsp sumac  
* 3 TSP salt  
* 1 TSP cinnamon  
* 1 TSP Bharat or Middle Eastern 7 spice  
* 1/2 TSP pepper  
* 1/2 TSP black lemon  
* 1/2 TSP paprika  
* 1/2 TSP coriander  

### Sauce:
* 1 Cup stock  
* 1/4 Cup pomegranate  
* 1/4 Cup tamarind  
* 1/8 Cup olive oil  
* 1.5 Tbsp tomato paste  
* 1.5 Tbsp lemon juice  
* 1 TSP salt  
* 1/2 TSP pepper  

You'll also need a couple of potatoes or 1 kg of lamb chops to line the base of the pot.

## Directions
### To prepare the vegetables:
1. Hollow out your vegetables using a vegetable corer (Watch [my video](https://youtu.be/SwU2-5g39xk) for detailed instructions), making sure to retain the cores of the tomatoes and aubergines  
2. Blanch your swiss chard and vine leaves in boiling water for 90 seconds each, before trimming their stems  
3. For the stuffed onions, peel them and make a cut through to the centre of the onion before microwaving for 2 minutes. Allow to rest before peeling apart the layers  

### To make the stuffing:
1. Mince the Parsely, Dill, vegetable cores, and onions finely and add to a bowl  
2. Wash your rice thoroughly until water runs clear then add all of the filling ingredients to the same bowl  
3. Mix thoroughly until well combined and a homogenous texture forms  

### Stuffing the vegetables:
I'd highly recommend watching [my video](https://youtu.be/SwU2-5g39xk) as stuffing these can get technical
1. Stuff the aubergines by pushing rice through their opening until about 1/2cm (1/4in) from the top  
2. Stuff the peppers and tomatoes by filling with a tablespoon. Leave a gap of about 3/4cm (5/16in) in the tomatoes and a smaller gap in the peppers  
3. Stuff the onions by placing 1-2 tsp of stuffing on a single layer of the onion, then roll it onto itself till it wraps around at least twice  
4. Stuff the vine leaves and swiss chard by placing 2 tsp on the leaf and folding the bottom and sides of the leaf over the filling. Tuck the sides in as you roll the filling all the way to the end  
5. Prick the aubergines and peppers with a knife about 5-10 times each  

### Assembling the pot:
1. Place a layer of potatoes or lamb chops in the bottom of the pot to prevent the dolma from sticking  
2. Lay in the onions and then the vegetables on top of them in any order  
3. Place the leaf rolls last so they don't get squashed  

### To cook:
1. Place the pot on the stove on medium heat and cover with a lid, allow it to steam for 15 minutes  
2. Combine all the ingredients for the sauce together  
3. When the 15 minutes are up, pour the sauce over the dolma in an even manner. Stop adding sauce when the liquid reaches halfway up the height of the pot  
4. Bring to a boil and then turn the heat down to low. Cover and allow to cook for 45 minutes  
5. After 45 minutes you can remove the lid and allow the liquid to evaporate (optional)  

### To serve:
1. Place a plate or platter ontop of the pot and flip the pot over with the plate  
2. Allow to sit for a few minutes before removing the pot and serving immediately

## Tips and tricks
* If you want to take this dolma to the next level, I'd recommend lining the pot with a layer of lamb chops. Get 1kg (2lbs) of thick cut lamb chops and season them with 2 Tsp of salt, 1 Tsp of 7 spice, then place in the bottom of the pot before adding the dolma.
* Another common addition for Iraqi dolma, is fava beans. You can add these in the bottom of the pot and they should absorb excess liquid.

INGREDIENTS

* 4 lbs Vegetables
* 4 litres cold water
* Onions, Garlic, Carrots, Leaks, Fennel, turnips
* tomatoes should be used only is you do not want a clear white stock
* White wine (optional)
* vegetable oil (for sweating vegetables)

SPICE SACHET

* Bay leaf    2 
* Thyme sprigs   3 
* Peppercorns    1 tsp 
* Parsley Stems   6-8 
* Garlic cloves crushed  2 

METHOD

* Sweat vegetables prior to adding water (Optional). Sweating vegetables extracts flavor and juices.
* To Sweat vegetables (sweat in the stock pot):
   * heat stock pot and oil to high, add vegetables.
   * Sweat for about 6 minutes but do not let the vegetables brown.
   * add white wine (optional)
* add cold water
* add spice sachet
* bring to simmer and skim off impurities regularly
* when stock is ready strain through china cap and cheesecloth
* cool the stock in a cold water bath and refrigerate
* Freeze.
* good for 4 days in the fridge

&amp;#x200B;

NOTES

The clearer the stock the longer the shelf life.

When cooling the stock it is important to do it quickly to avoid bacteria development. I take my stock pot off the stove and put it in a cold water bath in the sink with cold running water around the pot and ice (in the sink) if I have it. I stir the water away from the pot and let some drain as the water heats up. I also take a bottle (I use a mouthwash bottle full of water that is vacuum sealed in plastic and frozen) and drop it into the strained stock to cool it from within. I reseal the bottle after every use with clean sanitized plastic. Once the stock cool enough to handle I put it in 750ML containers, put it in the fridge to further cool and then freeze it the next day. It can stay in the fridge for up to 4 days put after that it is in the bacterial risk zone.

NEVER SALT YOUR STOCK - stock is used for many things and should not be salted until its final destination. If you render it later you will concentrate the salt.

VARIATIONS

You can use a few liters from a previous stock to kick start the new batch. This will strengthen the flavor.

Recently however I've become watching a Japanese youtuber who actually shallow fries quite a bit of food. Vegetables, seafood, meats, croquettes etc.

However her set-up seems to be different each time and I can't seem to connect why she picks the setup she does each time. Like what is the deciding factor or benefits/downsides of each method.

For one sometimes she'll start off coating the food in either flour or some kind of starch (rice, potato), but not always.

Then the next step is sometimes just an eggwash. Sometimes she'll make a batter with flour + water, or sometimes flour + water+ egg or flour + milk.

Then lastly she'll coat in breadcrumbs and fry (or leave them out. But I do understand that just frying something in batter vs coating in breadcrumbs will give different results and will be a personal preference mostly).

So does anyone know why she goes between the different batter/egg wash configurations?

Also on an unrelated note I've seen her coat her foods in flour or starch before just popping them in a pan as well. Is there any reason or benefit to this? For example recently she had little boiled quail eggs that she rolled in flour. Then she coated them in bacon and coated the outside in flour as well, then popped them in a pan. But I've seen her do it with meats, fish, vegetables (she did it with spinach recently). Is there a reason she does/doesn't do this at times.

Mainly I really want to try to do lesser calories versions of her foods at home (I'm not on a diet, just try to keep unnecessary calories at bay if I can). Leaving the flour out seems like a pretty straight-forward way to cut down some calories. But obviously I'm kind of curious as to what I'd be missing out on and why she does this in the first place.

Also sorry if this is a stupid question. I'm usually very much  a follow the recipe kind of person. But after seeing her cook for a long time I've become kind of curious as to the ""why"" behind various things she does.

879,2021-03-19T10:46:58Z,0.0,m8itzu,t3,,0.0,"# BROWN STOCK - Beef or Veal

INGREDIENTS

* Bones: veel or beef
* cold water
* mirepoix - 50% onions, 25% celery, 25% carrots (guidelines - save your carrot ends and celery leaves, onion skins and freeze them)
* tomato paste
* Ratios 100% water, 50% bones, 10% mirepoix (these are guidelines)

METHOD

* Cut bones into 3-4 inch pieces with meat saw
* Do not wash the bones
* Roast in a roasting pan at 400F and brown them well
* Remove bones from roast pan and place in stock pot
* Cover with cold water
* Bring to a simmer
* Skim as required
* Drain Fat from the Roasting Pan and reserve it for later
* Deglaze roasting pan with water (scrape the pan bits off)
* Add mirepoix to the pan, add some of the reserved fat and brown the mirepoix in the oven.
* Add tomato paste to the pan and continue to brown until mirepoix is a rusty color.
* Add the browned mirepoix, sachet aromatics and additional tomato paste (if any) to the pot.
* Continue to simmer and skim
* Veal 6 hours, Beef 8 hours
* Strain through a china cap lined with layers of cheesecloth.
* Cool the stock in a cold water bath and refrigerate.
* Freeze.

NOTES

Beef and Veal has gelatin so a good stock will be gelatinous. Wobbly, darkish, and like jello.

Starting with cold water lets the temperature rise slowly letting out any impurities in the bones slowly and allowing them to rise to the top. this makes for a much clearer stock. Skim, Skim, Skim,

The clearer the stock the longer the shelf life.

When cooling the stock it is important to do it quickly to avoid bacteria development. I take my stock pot off the stove and put it in a cold water bath in the sink with cold running water around the pot and ice (in the sink) if I have it. I stir the water away from the pot and let some drain as the water heats up. I also take a bottle (I use a mouthwash bottle full of water that is vacuum sealed in plastic and frozen) and drop it into the strained stock to cool it from within. I reseal the bottle after every use with clean sanitized plastic. Once the stock cool enough to handle I put it in 750ML containers, put it in the fridge to further cool and then freeze it the next day. It can stay in the fridge for up to 4 days put after that it is in the bacterial risk zone.

NEVER SALT YOUR STOCK - stock is used for many things and should not be salted until its final destination. If you render it later you will concentrate the salt.

VARIATIONS

You can use a few liters from a previous stock to kick start the new batch. This will strengthen the flavor.

You can simmer (30 min - 1 hour) and strain the bones to get rid of some of the impurities then start the first step in the method. This is personal preference. Some people say it takes out some of the flavor but it will give you a clearer stock. Skimming takes care of this if you don't simmer and strain.

914,2021-03-18T14:18:03Z,0.0,m7x5y7,t3,,3.0,"# BROWN STOCK

INGREDIENTS

* Bones: veal or beef
* cold water
* mirepoix - 50% onions, 25% celery, 25% carrots (guidelines - save your carrot ends and celery leaves, onion skins and freeze them)
* tomato paste
* Ratios 100% water, 50% bones, 10% mirepoix (these are guidelines)

METHOD

* Cut bones into 3-4 inch pieces with meat saw
* Do not wash the bones
* Roast in a roasting pan at 400F and brown them well
* Remove bones from roast pan and place in stock pot
* Cover with cold water
* Bring to a simmer
* Skim as required
* Drain Fat from the Roasting Pan and reserve it for later
* Deglaze roasting pan with water (scrape the pan bits off)
* Add mirepoix to the pan, add some of the reserved fat and brown the mirepoix in the oven.
* Add tomato paste to the pan and continue to brown until mirepoix is a rusty color.
* Add the browned mirepoix, sachet aromatics and additional tomato paste (if any) to the pot.
* Continue to simmer and skim
* Veal 6 hours, Beef 8 hours
* Strain through a china cap lined with layers of cheesecloth.
* Cool the stock in a cold water bath and refrigerate.
* Freeze.

NOTES

Beef and Veal has gelatin so a good stock will be gelatinous. Wobbly, darkish, and like jello.

Starting with cold water lets the temperature rise slowly letting out any impurities in the bones slowly and allowing them to rise to the top. this makes for a much clearer stock. Skim, Skim, Skim,

The clearer the stock the longer the shelf life.

When cooling the stock it is important to do it quickly to avoid bacteria development. I take my stock pot off the stove and put it in a cold water bath in the sink with cold running water around the pot and ice (in the sink) if I have it. I stir the water away from the pot and let some drain as the water heats up. I also take a bottle (I use a mouthwash bottle full of water that is vacuum sealed in plastic and frozen) and drop it into the strained stock to cool it from within. I reseal the bottle after every use with clean sanitized plastic. Once the stock cool enough to handle I put it in 750ML containers, put it in the fridge to further cool and then freeze it the next day. It can stay in the fridge for up to 4 days put after that it is in the bacterial risk zone.

NEVER SALT YOUR STOCK - stock is used for many things and should not be salted until its final destination. If you render it later you will concentrate the salt.

VARIATIONS

You can use a few liters from a previous stock to kick start the new batch. This will strengthen the flavor.

Looking for your experiences with managing small amounts of deep fryer oil.

**Background:**

I have a small experimental kitchen which includes a one gallon Kalerik deep fryer.

It filters nicely into a catch tub.

Maximum Temperature is 375 F. Oil stays hot for less than an hour 2 to 3 times a week.

I use canola exclusively but would consider other moderately priced high temp oils.

**Storage Method:**

I keep three 1 gallon jugs rotated and marked with round and number of times used.

They stay in cold storage.

Jug 1: New oil used for light taste like dough.

Jug 2: Meat but not fish.

Jug 3: Fish.

I'll cook potatoes in all three :)

**Discussion:**

I'm not getting paid to use the oil so I need to maximize life span and minimize flavor.

Would a paper filter be worth using given the scale and oil costs? Any DYI versions?

How many times could I use the oil? If I use each Jug 3 times and rotate that's nine cooks.

Given the work load, does that sound high or low?

Is there a cost benefit to using a different oil?

Has anyone ever polished their oil? How beneficial is that?

INGREDIENTS

* 8 units - Chicken bones
* 1 unit - Mirepoix - 50% onions, 25% celery, 25% carrots (guidelines - save your carrot ends and celery leaves, onion skins, kale spines, broccoli stems, and freeze them)
* cold water
* Ratios 100% water, 50% bones, 10% mirepoix (these are guidelines)

METHOD

* rinse the bones with cold water
* put the bones in pot
* add cold water to no more than 2 inches over bones.
* heat but do not boil, bring to a simmer. boiling will make the stock cloudy,
* add in the mirepoix 1/2 way through the cooking process.
* skim the stock through the process. it will take about 4 hours.
* when done, strain the stock through a china cap and cheesecloth. discard the mirepoix.
* cool in an ice bath and store covered in the fridge no longer than 4 days.
* Freeze.

NOTES

Starting with cold water lets the temperature rise slowly letting out any impurities in the bones slowly and allowing them to rise to the top. this makes for a much clearer stock. Skim, Skim, Skim,

The clearer the stock the longer the shelf life.

When cooling the stock it is important to do it quickly. Especially chicken stock so as to avoid bacteria development. I take my stock pot off the stove and put it in a cold water bath in the sink with cold running water around the pot and ice (in the sink) if I have it. I stir the water away from the pot and let some drain as the water heats up. I also take a bottle (I use a mouthwash bottle full of water that is vacuum sealed in plastic and frozen) and drop it into the strained stock to cool it from within. I reseal the bottle after every use with clean sanitized plastic. Once the stock cool enough to handle I put it in 750ML containers, put it in the fridge to further cool and then freeze it the next day. It can stay in the fridge for up to 4 days put after that it is in the bacterial risk zone.

NEVER SALT YOUR STOCK - stock is used for many things and should not be salted until its final destination. If you render it later you will concentrate the salt.

VARIATIONS

You can simmer (30 min - 1 hour) and strain the bones to get rid of some of the impurities then start the first step in the method. This is personal preference. Some people say it takes out some of the flavor but it will give you a clearer stock. Skimming takes care of this if you don't simmer and strain.

You can use a few liters from a previous stock to kick start the new batch. This will strengthen the flavor.

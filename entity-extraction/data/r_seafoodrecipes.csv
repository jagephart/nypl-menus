When it comes to king crab legs, I can see parts of the meat have a little freezer burn in the end part where it was detached from the crab. 

My question is... What's the likelihood the inner sections of legs that are in shell likely still fine? I.e. if I break off the ends that are freezer burnt?",Seafood,King Crab Legs and Freezer Burn?!,9.0,1.0

Two questions. I bought smoked  mackerel today at the fish store. forgot to ask the lady do i need to  cook it or what. I cut it in half just to fit in my glass container and  from the looks of it, it looks like its cooked( i could be wrong).  Do I  need to cook it or something or is it safe to eat now?

Also  i got some oysters too. I bought 5 for the week(going to last 6 days as  i fast one day). How do i make sure they last for 5 or 6 days. Im not  sure if they die or what.  I remember someone telling me to cook them  then store them back in the freezer and they last the week that way...  anyone any insight on this.

Anyhow, I have been having trouble keeping these clams, mussels and oysters. I started noticing that they start to open up and die really soon. I was wondering if anyone had any good, solid advice on how to keep these things alive and healthy in the seafood case as long as possible.

I have heard so many different conflicting rules on them: soak them in warm water, soak them in fresh water, out ice on them, don't out ice on them, cover them with a damp cloth, don't cover them... etc, etc. It is hard to determine what to really do.

Currently I have been soaking them in cold water for about 30 minutes then strain them and return them to the case, but this doesn't seem efficient. I am considering just doing a quick rinse daily to rehydrate them since they look so dry when I see them. 

I dont believe saltwater or a damp cloth are option because they are on display and we have no plain salt back there...

Any consistent advice at all or something to put it all together would be cer helpful, thanks!",Seafood,"New Seafood Clerk... Need advice for keeping shellfish? (Clams, mussels, oysters)",2.0,1.0

I have filleted whole salmon and trout before but this will be my first tuna. It doesn‚Äôt look like the fish has been gutted, would this also be unbled? Do I need to scale it? The tail is trimmed off. 

I have also seen some posts around the internet saying to only clean tuna and other saltwater fish with saltwater as freshwater/tap water may ruin the taste.

Any info is appreciated thanks so much!

I am embarking on a journey to eat more seafood for better health. I am trying to eat the freshest and least contaminated fish I can find.

A local fresh fish purveyor has ""golden bass"" caught in Canada fresh for sale, not expensive, 11 dollars per pound. It smells really fresh and tastes great.

My question is: how does such fresh fish make it all the way from Canada to southern California without getting a ""smell"" to it? 

Also, does anyone know if golden bass is a river or ocean fish?

Thanks,

From Mike and Alex on 8/13/2020:

For Anchorage, AK residents: We are a commercial set net operation offering fresh caught salmon directly to the consumer. Upon capture, our salmon are immediately bled and chilled on slush ice until they are delivered the following day. The fish are delivered gutted and gilled, and all weights are taken after gutting. We are DEC permitted, and licensed as a direct marketer. Currently we are catching mostly silvers, which we are selling at $5/lb, and have limited availability for reds, which are $7/lb. Deliveries to Merrill Field are made on Tuesdays and Fridays. PM me to place an order. -Salmon HookUp

For lower 48 states, we can ship via Alaska Air Cargo for orders of 100 lbs or more.

I was born in Vancouver and have lived in Toronto too, and I've never seen them sold live in either city!

How's [*Macleans*](https://www.macleans.ca/society/why-canadas-seafood-market-is-so-bad-and-costs-so-much/#gallery/shellfish/slide-1) correct that Canadians can't afford our local seafood? Or are affluent Asians just more willing to spend more money on our seafood, even compared to the affluent in Toronto and Vancouver? 

&gt; This is where the new piscine economics get interesting‚Äîespecially in the way we get to lose. Take, for example, lobster. Four years ago Canada‚Äîand Maine‚Äîproduced a glut. The slumping price drew attention from the Chinese, who suddenly tuned in to how much cheaper our commodity was than, say, cheaper-to-ship ‚Äúsea bugs‚Äù (flathead lobsters) from Australia. And once hooked, the Chinese have stayed that way, regardless of the rising price. In 2011, they bought just $27 million worth of Canadian lobster; in 2016, it was $161 million‚Äîa nearly 500 per cent increase in five years.
&gt; 

&gt; Meanwhile, they can still afford the crustaceans‚Äîand us, not so much. And the exact same thing is happening in countless other seafood categories. From geoduck clams from B.C. and cod milt from the Atlantic to live eels from New Brunswick and Quebec, all the stuff you wish you could find at your local fishmonger is headed to China or Japan, and we‚Äôre left with frozen halibut and farmed salmon.

&gt; Our fish markets should be a source of national pride but instead are an embarrassment. When over the past few years top American chefs including Daniel Boulud and David Chang opened up in Toronto, our fish markets were the first thing they complained about (‚ÄúDisgusting,‚Äù one of them was reported to have remarked). Montreal‚Äôs are marginally better, but no longer as good as they were 20 years ago. Vancouver‚Äôs are not nearly as impressive as they should be; the appetite for Asian delicacies helps, but the variety of species is still meek. It all puts a happy spin on spending a 75-cent dollar on Canadian fish in NYC. For you won‚Äôt find a place doing such a nice job of it here, anywhere, _a mari usque ad mare_‚Äîwe‚Äôre too busy freezing and processing it all for export.",Seafood,"Why don't we sell some of our live seafood like whelks and sea cucumbers in Canada, rather than exporting them all?",2.0,1.0

so i heat up the pan with some oil, drop in both fillets, and cover it up - everything the same i have for thousands of fillets before.  anyway - i take the lid off after a couple minutes and the fillets are the same kind of transparent as they are raw but sort of broken apart and curled up.  i put the lid back on and waited a little longer and it had the same appearance and raw consistency - it kind of reminded me of this fermented fish jerky i had in iceland.  it eventually did turn to a cooked white color but was dried out and stringy.

i can‚Äôt imagine where i would have gone wrong so i suspect it either wasn‚Äôt tilapia or the bag had gone through some freeze-thaw cycles in the supply chain going to the supermarket.  i read you can cook some fish straight from the freezer after rinsing the ice off and drying them - should i try that next?",Seafood,forever frozen fish,3.0,0.81

however I was thinking some kind of raw, clean tasting fish would go well. maybe something that would typically be used on sushi...

Caviar really cant be beaten in my opinion, but its just too expensive for regular use... so something similar.. fresh, clean, with a little brine or mineral flavor... gota be something else.

I‚Äôm 28, and my only recollection of oysters was when I was about 16-17, I assumed it tasted like a clam, but it didn‚Äôt. I remember being disgusted by its extremely strong sea flavor.

But, being 28 now, my pallate has changed, I still can‚Äôt really stand sashimi or raw fish (ill happily eat sushi, even if uncooked.  Strange, I know..). 
But I otherwise love seafood in all of its forms, especially mussels and clams.

So in comparison, what should I expect flavor wise, to clams and mussels, or will it taste more or less the same?

Also, if I don‚Äôt like raw salmon etc, what is the likelihood I won‚Äôt like raw oysters? I‚Äôm also low key afraid of food poisoning lol.

I live in California, so most of our seafood is pretty fresh.

What sea food is best for beginner sea food explorers? 

I do know that if you go to a market you should look for fish with little to no smell and it should either be alive or on ice? 

I might look into getting a small amount of clams and muscles just to try those, I‚Äôm interested in trying crawdads. Going to make everything pretty plain so I can really taste the flesh. 

Any advice and tips are welcome! Thank you!",Seafood,Looking to venture into ‚Äúsea food‚Äù...,14.0,1.0

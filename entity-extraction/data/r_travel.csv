Accordingly, /r/travel is continue its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates.

In the interest of reducing the number of one-off questions, **before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans, consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following:**

## Are borders open? What entry or transit restrictions are in place? Will I need to quarantine?

A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources, including from [IATA](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm) or [Kayak's travel restriction map](https://www.kayak.com/travel-restrictions). Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air (so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures).

You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country (and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country). **Because information can change on short notice, it is important to verify the latest information, ideally from government sources.**

## ...in the US?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in or transited via Brazil, China, Iran, Ireland,  the Schengen Area, South Africa, or the UK in the preceding 14 days. Exceptions to this rule include green card holders as well as some family members of US citizens and permanent residents. *Note that (except for, of course, US citizens) this is not a citizenship-based restriction; it is purely based on travel history.* More information about the entry restrictions and the associated proclamations is available on the [US CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html).

All air passengers (including US citizens and green card holders), regardless of origin and nationality, [need to produce a negative result](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html) from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US. Alternatively, you may travel with a positive test result from the previous 3 months and a letter from a doctor indicating that you're clear for travel. The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes, but [air, rail, and sea (but not commuter rail or ferry) ports-of-entry remain open](https://ca.usembassy.gov/travel-restrictions-fact-sheet/) to non-essential travel.

No nationwide quarantine requirements exist, although an executive order signed on Jan. 21 hinted at the possibility of one being instituted, should the CDC recommend it. Nevertheless, individual states and/or cities may have their own requirements, even for domestic travel, so you will need to confirm with information from your destination state or city. As an example, [this is New York State's travel advisory/quarantine page](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory); note that *travelers are permitted to break quarantine to leave New York State and the state's quarantine restrictions would not prevent you from boarding a connecting flight*. New York's testing and quarantine requirements are ending for domestic travelers as of Apr. 1.

For more information, see [the US CDC's COVID-19 page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).

## ...in Canada?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain, mostly essential reasons, *regardless of mode of travel*. Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions. Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for non-essential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents. Note that Canadian airlines will be halting flights to Mexico and the Caribbean. Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Fully airside international transits are typically permitted.

All passengers five years or older arriving into Canada by air will also need to [produce a negative result from a PCR test](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying) taken within 72 hours prior to boarding the last direct flight to Canada. Alternatively, you may submit a positive COVID-19 molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days prior to departure.

Passengers are required to take an additional test on arrival and quarantine at hotels for at least three days, pending negative test results, in one of four cities – Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal – that will serve as the only ports-of-entry by air. After being permitted to exit hotel quarantine, travelers must continue to self-quarantine until 14 days after arrival, at which point they must take another test. The whole process is expected to cost approximately C$2000 per passenger, which travelers will have to pay. 

For more information, see [the Canadian government's COVID-19 travel restrictions page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/travel-restrictions-exemptions.html).

## ...in Mexico?

At the time of writing, there are no changes to Mexico's standard entry requirements. However, the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes. Travelers must fill out a ""Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers"", available here, to present upon arrival. There are no quarantine requirements upon arrival in Mexico.

For more information, see information provided by Mexican embassies, including the [Mexican Embassy in the Netherlands](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/paisesbajos/index.php/foreign-nationals/frequent-questions).

## ...in the UK?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are barred from entering the UK if they have entered or transited South America, Panama, the UAE, or several countries in southern Africa within the previous 10 days are not permitted to enter the UK. The [full ""red list"" of countries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19#travel-bans-to-the-uk---banned-countries) is subject to change. Irish citizens and those with UK resident permits are, in addition to UK nationals, exempted from this restriction.

All passengers entering or transiting through the UK from outside the Common Travel Area (which comprises the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands) need to produce a negative PCR, LAMP, or antigen test taken within 72 hours of their last direct flight (or other mode of transit) to the UK. All international arrivals (including UK citizens) will need to quarantine for 10 days after arrival. Passengers who have not been in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days may shorten their quarantines in England if they [test negative](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel) at least 5 days into their quarantine period.

All travelers, regardless of origin and nationality, traveling from outside the Common Travel Area will, in addition to getting tested before departure, need to take a test on the second and eighth days after arrival; this requirement even applies to those using the ""test-to-release"" scheme. These tests need to be [pre-booked before departure](https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/). 

All travelers that have been in any of the ""red list"" countries over the previous ten days must book, at their own expense, a hotel room for their quarantine. For those destined for Scotland, *all travelers* who have been outside the Common Travel Area in the previous ten days must book a hotel room for their quarantines. These hotel rooms must be [booked in advance](https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/), along with the mandatory tests on the second and eighth days of quarantine.

With ""lockdown"" measures in place within the UK, there may be restrictions on travel purposes to, from, or within the constituent countries. For example, [travel to and from Scotland is prohibited](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-travel-and-transport/) except for limited purposes.

For more information, see [UK Border Control](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control) and the [UK government's information about travel measures](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19).

## ...in the EU? In the Schengen Area?

In late June, the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to short-term visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus. This [list has been updated](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic_en), as of Jan. 28, to consist of Australia, China (subject to confirmation of reciprocity), New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. This list, however, is non-binding among member countries and is subject to change.

Nevertheless, several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance, permitting arrivals from these countries as well as ""EU+"" countries (which includes EU and Schengen countries, and sometimes the UK). These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history and/or residency; consult resources from your destination country. However, multiple EU countries have temporarily placed additional restrictions on travel from specific countries (e.g. the UK) or have reinstated broad restrictions for those from outside the EU, the Schengen Area, or their own countries due to discoveries of new COVID variants. Fully airside non-Schengen to non-Schengen transits are typically permitted, but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation (which may, at times, include negative test results) is required.

As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to third-country nationals in various ways and with different exceptions, it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their ports-of-entry. A summary of travel restrictions is [provided by the European Union](https://reopen.europa.eu/en), but many have reported that government (e.g. embassy or foreign ministry) resources have been more detailed and accurate.

## ...in South Korea?

At the time of writing, [most nationalities](http://viewer.moj.go.kr/skin/doc.html?rs=/result/bbs/229&amp;fn=temp_1586503947805100) with visa-free or visa-waiver arrangements with Korea have had their visa-free/waiver status suspended, primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens. There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China.

All passengers must have a negative LAMP, PCR, SDA, or TMA test taken within 72 hours of departure of the first flight en route to Korea. International arrivals, with very few exceptions, will be required to quarantine for 14 days; non-residents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense.

For more information, see the [Korea Immigration Service](http://www.immigration.go.kr/immigration_eng/index.do).

## ...in Japan?

At the time of writing, foreign nationals who have been in one of 150+ countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan. Further, visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended. Permanent residents, long-term residents, and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions.

Those individuals, including Japanese citizens, that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine. All travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan. Additional restrictions are in place for those travelling from the UK or South Africa.

For more information, see the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html).

## When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted? Is it safe/a good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead?

It is, of course, impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country. Where no news has been officially provided, it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures (e.g. economic or social).

Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable. Even with the vaccine rollouts, it's unclear how this will affect travel restrictions and procedures. In the meantime, with the resurgences of cases in several countries, the new variants recently discovered in several countries, and the onset of the Northern Hemisphere winter, some countries have firmed up travel restrictions, requiring additional tests or quarantine periods or preventing travel from certain locations. Further, even if you are ultimately able to travel to your destination, there may be ""lockdowns"" or widespread closures of businesses and places of interest.

Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel, or even will remain as liberal as they are in your destination today. With this unprecedented situation, old adages about when it's best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid. In any event, be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits and/or refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel.

Further, understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund, even if legally required. Many travelers have reported waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund. And be aware that if your airline goes out of business, your funds could be lost forever.

Take note of your jurisdiction's laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights. For example:

* [US Dept of Transportation: Refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds)
* [EU: Air passenger rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm)

## So should I cancel a trip that I've already booked? And how? Will insurance help?

These questions were covered at length in the [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fjhjoz/coronavirus_megathread_for_travelrelated/). Although countries may be starting to ""reopen"", the points therein are still relevant.

1,2020-12-09T23:21:25Z,0.0,ka8dhm,t3,modpost,291.0,"**We are getting dozens of low effort posts a day from 17-24 year olds asking the same questions, so I’m going to start this Megathread to help capture and answer them.**

I don’t know if it’s your family pressuring you over the holidays or the end of the semester and you are focused on your future plans, or just hype for what the new year of 2021 will bring but your query isn’t unique. Tons of your peers are asking the same questions.

**The script usually goes like this:**

&gt; Hey, I’m *(between 17-24)* and I want to travel because:

&gt;* I don’t want to work for the man/Work as a Wage Slave/Work a boring 9-5/don’t need a career/I don't feel fulfilled
* I want a gap year
* I want to find/discover myself and or any other spiritual or mental health quest
* Just fucking leave/get out of the same old things/rut that I’m in

&gt;I think it would be fun to travel because (pick any/more than one)

&gt;* I want to experience other cultures
* I want to try new food
* I want to meet new people
* I want to get out of my comfort zone
* I want to just get a one way ticket and just experience things with no plans
* Etc

&gt;Then the post usually asks more than one of the following:

&gt;* Where is safe for a first-time traveler? 
* Is it weird/scary to travel alone?
* Where is a cheap place I can travel as I have no money?
* Where can I up and move to? 
* Where can I easily get a job moving from place to place?
* Where can I volunteer at a place that will pay me to do so?
* I’ve never traveled before can someone give me a step by step on how to take a bus/train/flight as I’m afraid?
* How much should I budget (and then provides no information to help)
* What should I pack?

&gt;Or age specific questions like:

&gt;* How can I rent a hotel room under 21?
* How can I rent a car under 25?

But the key thing is these posts often do not have enough info to meet our submission guidelines or even have done any research and so the posts are often removed.

We get it, you are young and excited. You also have been cooped up with COVID and want to just get out there. But we need more to go on. 

So I’m creating the Megathread so all young people/first time travelers can get the same information in one place, instead of dozens of threads all of ther place. As well as all of our great community members to share your wonderful wisdom in one place as well.

Also please note, it is NOT a good time to travel right now during the pandemic. I’m not advocating that you do this right now. But to have this thread be of help in your planning for when it is safe to travel again.

Good Luck and Happy 2021 Travels

## Some General Tips:

* You still need to do research and planning. Lookup that the entry/visa requirements are. Some countries do not allow one-way tickets, while others may require you show proof of exit or bank statements showing you can support yourself and you won't be working illegally. We have had people not allowed on their initial flights or deported back instantly for not doing the bare minimum of research.
* In the sidebar there are guides and wikis from how to buy Airfare and Navigating Airports, What to Pack, etc. Please make use of these resources.
* You need money to travel. For Savings/Budgeting/Money Questions utilize the many great subreddits like /r/personalfiance &amp; /r/frugal. Also checkout online cost of living resources like https://www.numbeo.com/ There are also specific subreddits for ultra low fund travel like /r/vagabond /r/Shoestring 
* /r/solotravel is a great resource as well and /r/travelpartners can be used to find travel partners
* Working Abroad/Volunteering requires a Work Visa in 99.9% of cases. Yes, this includes volunteering in trade for food &amp; board like Workaway/WWOOF etc.  Also freelance/digital jobs. For legit Working Abroad/Moving Abroad questions use /r/IWantOut, for the grey area of digital use /r/digitalnomad. Also google ""Voluntourism"" to understand why ""Volunteering"" is expensive and generally doesn't help the community.
* If your question is ""Should I stay in my job or travel now?"" First talk with people in your career or industry to understand if a gap is okay, try /r/findareddit to find people to talk to. Then remember that its not an all or nothing thing. Some people take a short vacation. Others a few months off. Yes some do take a year or more off. While others work the 9-5 and take time off as allowed. Or take shorter term jobs and travel in off periods/between contracts. 
* Just looking for a new place to live, try /r/samegrassbutgreener or a local subreddit as we don't handle general moving questions.
* Search the subreddit, its been around for years and 99% of the time your question has been answered before. Or a location you are interested has been discussed.
* Grab a guidebook, or use a free online version like Wikivoyage to learn more about potential destinations.

Even if they deduct her credit of 1400usd it will be 6600usd. Which is ridiculous. She can't buy the new flight tickets because Priceline said those are discounted and not rebooking rates.

Is it possible to just get a refund of her 1400usd flight instead of the credit now because she can't afford the rebooking rates. New flight tickets are just 1400usd.

It sounds like a scam to me and I don't want my gf to be out of 1400usd when it was priceline that canceled her flight. She also can't see the rebooking rates on the website, she has to call priceline to use her credit and the rates she's been given is ridiculous.

My girlfriend and I are looking to vacation on a beach in the U.S. in mid-to-late July, for something between 1-2 weeks. We're both late 30s, no kids. We really just want to relax, drink, swim, eat good cheap food, read a couple books, maybe some live music, and not be crowded by many people (even though we'll be vaccinated). It's basically peak vacation season, so that last part might be tricky, but to whatever extent that's possible. Our budget for hotel would be like $200 to $300 a night. We live in DC, but I think since it's over a week that it doesn't need to be limited to the East Coast.

**Thinking So Far:**

From my research so far, I  ruled out much of California's coast (at least further up north) because people seem to suggest the water temperates are too cold year-round (which surprised me), though I'm guessing that's not the case around San Diego so maybe there. Hawaii seems like a maybe. On the East Coast, looks like there are good beaches in DE, NJ, NY, CT that might fit the bill but having trouble figuring out which of the dozens of beaches would make the most sense. Going further south, there's OBX and then a couple redditors mentioned Jekyll Island in GA. And then Puerto Rico seems like it might make a lot of sense,  too, since it's not quite peak storm season yet -- specifically a few days in Culebra, before going to the main island.

If we did decide to leave the country, which I kinda hate to do because pandemic makes things so uncertain globally in terms of what's safe and open, maybe I should be considering Mexico (Todos Santos, though that specifically looks too small to spend more than several days.

I booked a fairly cheap roundtrip flight from LAX to TLL for Sept 2021 ($495 USD). I get in on a Friday afternoon and will depart the following Weds morning. I was thinking of spending 3 days in Tallinn and doing an overnight side trip to Riga (2 days total). From the brief research I did, I don’t think I will need 5 days in Tallinn so I figured a quick side trip to another city/country would be fun. I know Riga is about 5 hours away but I think there’s a bus service between the two cities. 

My plan is to stay at the Hilton in Tallinn. I know it’s just outside the old town but I don’t mind  the walk. I got nothing else to do. LOL. 

Another option would be the ferry to Helsinki. This is a great option but truth be told, I have heard so many great things about Finland that I would rather make that a longer trip for a later time. 

Why Tallinn and Riga? I love history and I’m a huge fan of the Eastern European/former Soviet Bloc countries. Don’t know why. They are just fascinating for me. I love the old world architecture, history and charm.

I understand both sides of the story.

However it takes the effort of everyone for it to truly be effective and safe .

“Don’t come here” “stay home” “it’s a pandemic why are you going anywhere”.

**Cuba**

\- Havana

I know I did not write anything about Amazon expeditions. But here our choices for it: 

\- Leticia  
\- Rurranabuque  
\- Iquitos  
\- Francisco de Orellana  
\- Puerto Maldonado

We will chose 2 of these and we will stay 3 days in both area. 

We can't see Galapagos Island because it is too expensive, so maybe we can see poor man's galapagos islands in Ecuador or Peru. (Isla del Plate or Islas Ballestas) We will decide it there. 

I am not sure about to see Cartagena in Colombia, Guayaquil in Ecuador, Huaraz in Peru, Copacabana in Bolivia and Salvador in Brazil. 

In our journey, we will consider time, price and safety for transportation. Maybe I can rent a car in Mexico (from Cancun to Merida) and Costa Rica. We can take buses for long distances if it feels safe. Also we will check for cheap flights. 

We can stay 

So at the end, we have a budget of 15k usd for 2. But we can incrase it to 20k usd. We didn't include our flight to continent from Europe.

Landing at Heathrow Airport; I was forced by a border control officer to buy a home test kit from a specific provider despite having tests booked from a genuine, valid and authorised test center under threat I would be denied entry if I don't, my passport was given to and handled and held ransom in exchange for purchasing this home kit. Was this right?

**Background**

Last week I came back from a business trip to Denmark; It's a trip I had no choice but to take.

Until the trip took place, my partner and I have been isolating pretty strictly; she's asthmatic and we didn't want to take any chances, and so I've followed the confusing guidelines and even beyond, and I've kept it as strict as possible even during the trip, from isolating after I landed in Denmark, to getting tested 4 times, washing my hands, wearing masks and staying away from people.

Getting ready to come back to the UK, I tested negative a few hours before my flight, filled up the passenger locator form, and booked two tests as required, on the second and eighth day after landing through Collinson.

Flying back was a tiring experience; we waited 2 hours in the check the queue; it turns out many of the passengers weren't ready.

After landing I waited with my fellow passengers for 4 hours in Heathrow, wondering what the delays were caused by, assuming it was down to the number of border control officers or perhaps more passengers not being ready with the right documentation.

**I was wrong.**

I was ready with my documents - the passenger locator form, my passport, another form of ID, and the negative Covid test, determined to make this border control inspection as frictionless as possible, but the officer had a different agenda.

The officer began his ""inspection"" with the usual stuff; he asked where I came from, why I went, and why am coming back to the country where I live; he then asked for the negative test and the passenger locator form.

Now that he earned my trust, he started his attack, first asking for evidence that I booked the 2 tests, claiming the passenger locator form does not show any of this.

He was wrong - the passenger locator form can not be submitted without a valid reference number, but the officer was happy to claim he couldn't see it because he knew I wasn't going to argue when being denied entry to the country is at stake.

He then asked me to provide evidence emails from Collinson, which I had. On the surface this all seems so far legitimate, and here is where things turned.

The officer, now having seen the valid bookings - by valid I mean, I booked the two tests through an authorized provider, made his next argument - this time it wasn't clear. For about 10 minutes, he made pointless remarks on the distance between my house and the test center, using my passport and his pen as the two destinations, asking me over, ""what is in between them"".

I tried ""roads"", ""air"", and even ""coronavirus"", but I wasn't getting it right, while about 600 people were standing behind me in an endless queue, tired, waiting to get home, I then turned a little brave and asked the man to get to the point; which was

\- He didn't think Collinson was a ""good provider"".

\- According to him, people who are isolating should not be going outside to get tested.

\- The government's website where the passenger locator form is wrong, and that instead, I should follow his advice, which was to book a home test kit.

**Needless to say**

He did not explain why he thought Collisions was not a good provider, or evidence to support it, or why his opinion was even relevant

He did not provide evidence to support his medical opinion or why his opinion as someone without medical expertise is valid; that's beyond the fact that people, symptomatic or asymptomatic do go out to get tested

And he did not provide written evidence showing the government's website is wrong.

**But if it is not clear by now**

I was tired, stressed out, and I wasn't in a position to argue as annoying him, even if I was right would mean getting denied entry.

I also believed in good faith he was telling me the truth.

**What now? I asked**

Well, the officer, in his kindness said ""I like you, so I'll give you two options""

Option 1: refuse to follow his instructions, pay a £1,000 penalty, and be denied entry.

Option 2: go and book the home testing kit with his friend;

If it's not clear - under pressure and desire to cooperate, I agreed to option 2. The officer then called a suspicious-looking man, gave him my passport, and told him to ""do his job"". The man walked me to a corner at the airport, within seconds it was clear that the new man is was not a government official; he was working for a company selling these kits, barely spoke English, and now was holding my passport, demanding that I go to his website, pay £210 for the home testing kit.

I was not given the option to look through the companies and choose the company and product I buy, I was not given the option to compare companies, or challenge whether this entire process was even correct. It was paid for this specific product sold by this specific company, or you don't have your passport back.

And so I did, as the man was taking pictures of my passport and writing details while I was finding my way through a dodgy-looking website, wondering what I am doing.

I paid, and waited for an email with a receipt; when it didn't arrive for a few minutes, I asked the man to find out what happened. ""Don't worry"" he said, ""you can go home and the receipt will come later"". I refused. The man then claimed the receipt might be in my spam box. It wasn't, but he managed to raise more suspicion. Why would a receipt from a genuine company go to my spam inbox?

When no receipt arrived, I demanded him and now an English-speaking woman who was with him to produce one. The man took my phone, to look for the missing email, but instead, he began deleting my emails; I don't think it was intentional; he just seemed to not know how smartphones work.

As I was raising my voice, asking him to stop, the email finally arrived. and the man gave me back my passport;

5 hours after I landed, I finally was able to leave the airport; my partner; who was waiting outside, was asked to pay £5 for 30 minutes of waiting; she refused.

I was left to wonder what just happened. The following day I contacted the NHS team responsible for the passenger locator form and described what happened; I was told that my original test bookings were valid, that the officer was wrong, and that misconduct has been made, leaving me with a few conclusions:

* The officer was wrong; I had the right tests booked.
* The officer knew he was wrong and was pretty sneaky about it, instead of going straight to the point and make his argument rule-based; he first worked to convince me his logic was right, then said he ""liked me"" so and gave me these ""special options"", like a greasy salesman.
* He did not give me the chance to choose what I book - he brought someone to force me to book a specific product from a specific company, and government officials should not have that kind of preference
* He was wrong about the website, and even the penalty, which is £500
* I am wondering how many people in the airport had to go through this, and whether this is the reason why the queues are delayed.

**And this leaves me with a few questions:**

My friend and I are planning a road trip in a couple of years and these are our ideas so far. We are both from the UK, 30ish year old females and will be renting a car. We have both been to and driven America before but not these states

Fly into Orlando. Spend 2 nights in Orlando and visit Universal.

Travel up the coast towards Nashville. We have given ourselves 3 nights for this.

Arrive in Nashville spend 3 nights.

Travel to Houston. We have given ourselves 4 nights for this.

Arrive in Houston and spend 2 nights. We would like to see a Texans game

Travel to New Orleans spend 3 nights.

Travel back to Orlando, either all in one go or with a stopover.

We will be travelling over Christmas and the New Year (2023-2024). This itinerary leaves us somewhere between Nashville and Houston for Christmas and in New Orleans for New Years.

We like the idea of spontaneity so the current idea is to book hotels for Orlando, Nashville, Houston and New Orleans but not anywhere for the travel days. Is this a doable? We like the idea of finding a small town and staying a couple nights as we enjoy it, or the opposite and getting straight to our main destinations because we don't!

Another thing we thought of was weather. Are we likely to be disrupted by snow etc at this time of year?

I'm sorry if this isn't the best place to post this but I am a bit overwhelmed with trying to pick a destination for a vacation this spring/summer. My girlfriend and I had to cancel our one month Asia trip sadly due to the state of the world, although there are far bigger problems in the world. We are looking at staying closer to the US and doing a relaxing beach-type getaway, but we have slightly different desires. We are looking to drop like $2k/person on everything for a trip in Mid-May (9-10 days-ish). We want a beach experience, but not to be limited to the beach and not being able to leave a resort. we aren't heavy drinkers/party-goers, but would be nice to have that option every now and again.

For her, she is prioritizing a beautiful beach experience and adventure, whereas, I would like to have some town/city/cultural exploration nearby (I can't just sit on a beach all day for 10 days, I'd lose my mind). I like walking around, checking out markets, local food, culture. So, we want to have access to some amazing beaches (ideally calm, clear waters with minimal rocks/seaweed), with some adventure as well (snorkling) as well as atleast a small town or two close-ish to the resort/hotel. I'm sort of wondering if I'm looking for too much in one place. We were contemplating doing two destinations possibly (Miami for 3 days and then 6 days in Aruba), but all of the information out there is so hard to get a gauge on in terms of the best beaches.

I've looked at Hawaii, Mexico (Cancun/Tulum), Puerto Rico so far. Now, I'm looking at Turks &amp; Caicos, St. Martin, Bora Bora. I think we ruled out Dominican because it seems like you shouldn't leave the resort really (maybe this is a misconception). Hawaii seems like a great combination of all of the things we are looking for, but it's more expensive and you waste more time flying, which kind of sucks. Maybe two stops in Costa Rica would do it? But my girlfriend said when she was in Costa Rica, the water was super rough and not enjoyable.

We're both students, I graduated already, pursuing more school. She's still working on her undergrad. My girlfriend (20F) wants to travel to Europe from the U.S.. She wants to study abroad over the summer there and live there in the Fall. I don't really understand why. ***I've never lived or visited another country besides the U.S..*** I believe everyone, no matter where you go wants the same basic things, they want to feel loved, accepted, included, challenged, that they have a purpose, that they have a greater purpose, that they have intimacy, feel trusted, feel they have someone to trust, desire to better themselves (generally). I feel that no matter where you go, things will be roughly the same on the interpersonal level. I think I'm probably ignorant to all this, but in a sense, staying in the same place for a longer period of time is going to give you the chance to grow a stronger community, have more financial security, maybe more financial ambition, there are less variables to control and reduce. There are fewer barriers to these successes I think. You don't need to learn a new language for example. 

I'm concerned that my girlfriend wants to escape. Doesn't want to be here, but I feel that that is a mindset: wherever you go there will always be greener grass. Why not just travel for a vacation and get to enjoy the best things a culture has to offer, then come back home?

My husband and I got the opportunity to travel to Denver from may 26-30. While it's apparently my birth place, I've never been at a time I have any memory of it. My husband has also never visited. Flying into Denver international around 11am and we already have a rental car booked and ready to go so we don't mind driving **all** around

**Budget**: realistically, we'd like to stay ~$5-600 total for our hotel. We're not super snobs about hotels, but I am looking for something a little special since we're making this our ""year late honeymoon"" I'm not sure if and airbnb would be best or not. I've only ever stayed at one airbnb and there was no wifi (even though it was advertised) and the pool was super dirty so I'm nervous. 
I'm thinking the western side of Denver to be closer to the mountains

For adventure budget we've got ~$1,000 fun money. 

**Interests**
-My husbands a foodie we'd probably be catching food for most meals so definitely need some recommendations preferrably with outside seating. We like to find dives or local stuff. Breakfast and lunch spots we like casual, but for at least 2 nights we'd like something high end for dinner 

-I'm all about hiking and doing outdoor activities! Biking, rafting, kayaking and paddle boarding. I'd definitely like to spend one of our days only outdoors in the mountains hiking and I'd love a place we could canoe or kayak around 

-neither of us appreciate super large crowds and we're not big on doing night life stuff (except for fireworks)

-we both love flea markets and farmers markets

**Things I've googled and not sure if it's worth it** 
-botanical gardens (i'm interested and hyped, husband will go but he doesn't seem to be super stoked)
-red rock amphitheater (view looks amazing, but not sure if it is *safe* as far as social distancing)
-the art district (looks super cool but again concerned about how crowded it will be- husband is more likely to want to bail if it's too busy)

There's more I've considered but I came here for a more personal list than google. 

**Safety** obviously today's world is entirely different from two or more years ago. We will be masked and socially distancing as much as possible, sitting outside vs inside whenever we can and we're hoping to both be vaccinated before our trip but as of now we have some immunity from already getting it. Is there anything else we should be thinking about in regards to *this* safety? 


I can usually plan short distance trips in area's I know more about, but this is somewhat out of my comfort zone and I thought posting here would help. I've been googling for a week and I'm just so afraid to commit.

I have been trying for over a week to get an appointment with the same day passport agency, but there are no openings ever. I’ve tried every possible date, I renew it all day and night long, per recommendation of the agency in hopes I stumble upon a cancellation, but have not had any luck.

I’ve already pushed my trip back once (was supposed to leave yesterday), am about to push it back again (current flight scheduled for Tuesday), but the furthest I can push it back to is 3/9, and even with that date, there are no appointments available.

I don’t mind paying to overnight it by mail, paying for it to be expedited and paying for 1-2 day return mail, but even doing that still wouldn’t get it here in time most likely (I’ve read that it is taking them 3-5 weeks just to accept them into their system once they’re received).

We had plans last summer to do a rail trip through Spain France and Italy but obviously that didn’t happen. 

Now looking to book a flight in the next couple of weeks as the “no change fees” rule goes through March. So worst case I could just change the destination without penalty. 

Honestly we’d be willing to go anywhere. I saw that Iceland will open borders soon to vaccinated people, so that could be a top contender. There’s also Greece and Portugal which seem like potential options. And London seems particularly optimistic. I am also a dual citizen of us and U.K. so that would help me but not my partner.

I called Delta headquarters based on y'alls advice.  They gave me a customer service rep (I had tried to call before but had a five hour estimated hold).  This gentleman listened empathetically, agreed it wasn't Delta's corporate model and went further stating that autism and depression are medical issues, not mental.  He issued me a full refund on my non-refundable ticket AND told me how to get a refund for the travel insurance.  

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!  Y'all have no idea how having this one thing off my mind has helped!!!


******************************************
Let me know if there's a better place because I truly don't know where to post question.

My in-laws are dying. MIL has days, maybe weeks left as she's in congestive heart failure and can barely breathe.  Husband has been there three weeks.  Plan was for me to fly down and be with him for three more weeks and then another sibling takes over death watch.  

I purchased a cheap plane ticket but got travel insurance in case they died earlier than my trip.  Last Friday, I got a call from my high-functioning autistic son that he was basically considering suicide because his POS psychiatrist up and moved to another country and didn't tell him so now he has no meds and no doctor and OMFG I could kill this person.

I got a hold of his pediatric shrink who said he MUST move in with me for at least a month while we get him a new shrink, therapist and medical doctor.  I called travel insurance to see if we could cancel or even postpone trip.  Sounded like Allianz shipped me overseas based on connection quality as well as thick accent.  A gentleman who takes the phrase, ""the customer can hear your smile"" WAY too literally, cheerfully told me mental health isn't covered under plan.  He kept interrupting and actually had the balls to ask me to do a satisfaction survey after.

I called my husband and he said to just lie and say it's my back.  It would be easy enough to get a letter about it (not that I think they'd honor it).  But I feel Delta (the carrier) should know about how this company *who represents them* treats customers in dire situations.  It's the ethics of the thing.

So I need advice.  Should I lie to just get the thing done?  Am I fighting an unwinable battle out of the frustration I feel for my own crappy circumstances?  Or is it a good fight that should be fought?  I know it's stupid to ask the internet.  But y'all travel a lot and I could really use some input here.  

FWIW, for me it's not about the money. It's about the blowing off mental health issues as being not important.

Hello, first time posting here. I’m getting married in November of this year and my ideal honeymoon destinations are New Zealand and Iceland. Travel restrictions are preventing that, however, so we will likely go somewhere in the US. Our plans this far are the following:



-either early January or early Summer for the honeymoon


-staying for a week wherever we go


-budget is flexible depending on how desirable the destination and activities are. This will be a once in a lifetime event so we think it’s worthwhile 


We would like to be in a quieter place where things like bungee jumping, hiking, and beautiful scenery (on par with New Zealand and Iceland) are either close by or a short drive away. I assume any place we go to will have some sort of spa or place for her to be pampered available too.

This was our first real try at traveling together after a couple previous failed attempts and we were excited. A couple weeks after booking, my bf tells me that his younger brother learned about our travel plans and he too booked a flight/hotel to Miami. He planned to bring his gf as well. I don't know the brother very well but have met him a few times. I wasn't thrilled about them joining us as I was hoping for time for my boyfriend and I to hang out, do activities, etc. But I didn't say anything about it and just decided that we would make the best of it when we got there. 

When we get to Miami, we learn that the brother's gf is not coming. So the brother would be by himself on the trip along with the two of us. I felt bad for the brother, but I admitted to my bf that I was a little bothered by the fact that he would be the third wheel for the entirety of the trip. My bf gets really upset and defensive about me questioning his brother's presence on the trip and leaves me by myself only to join up with his brother for the rest of the trip. He felt insulted, but I have nothing against the brother- I just hate third wheel scenarios and feeling like the outsider on my own vacation.   My boyfriend then told me that his brother was welcome on any of his vacations and didn't see the problem. I ended up abandoned on vacation.

I am traveling to the UK from France on Saturday.

His screen is lightly scratched, I can unlock it and type a password and I have inserted a Sim card in every one. 
Is there any chance that I will have to pay some kind of tax for importing a new phone(despite that I am definitely not planning on selling it)? I am not sure that I will be able to do more than just to turn it on on the airport. I am also bringing a laptop and headphones but I doubt that they will make a problem for them.

Little did I know at the time, They are redundant in a lot of ways. I got them because I travel to Mexico a lot (via land crossing - occasionally using the Sentri lanes) and occasionally to Canada (via land and possibly flying but never did). Hence the reason I got all 3.  In any case, I have to renew now and lo and behold, I only have ONE active under my profile - NEXUS. I was expecting to see all 3, but somehow NEXUS supersedes the others. My primary goal is have the ability to cross either border using the Sentri or NEXUS lanes when needed. Now, to my question. If I renew NEXUS, do I still have access to Sentri lanes? Whatever I read does not explicitly say this. Compounding the problem is the confusing pricing of NEXUS ($50), Sentri ($122.50) and GE ($100). Logic dictates that Sentri is the best and covers everything since it’s most expensive and NEXUS the least, but that not true at all. 

What’s also is confusing is that I have a Global Entry card and on the back, it has the symbols for Sentri and ready lane. My NEXUS card only has the ready lane symbol. This also indicates that if I renew NEXUS, I cannot use Sentri. But I believe NEXUS can use Sentri lanes, but again, nowhere is this explicitly stated.",travel,Does NEXUS include SENTRI?,3.0,0.72

-Land in Las Vegas to see 7 Magic Mountains, the Hoover Dam and the strip  

-Then head to our hotel near Zion National Park and do some hiking in the morning and stay one more night and the head out.

- Afterwards, Head to Horseshoe Bend and Grand Canyon (stay near GC for two days and do some hiking there).

As a world travel addict it really bums me out to witness the US passport become nearly worthless.  What once allowed me to bounce around the planet without a care, rocking up to the vast majority of the worlds borders on a whim is now seen as a symbol of an out of control virus, of a contagious population that isn't welcome.  

If this pandemic hadn't occurred I'd be trekking across India right now, coming up from Sri Lanka and on my way to Nepal and Everest Base Camp before spending some time exploring the cultural and culinary delights of Japan. It was a trip I've been dreaming about since I was a kid but somehow still haven't gotten to do. Hopefully next year will be better...   

I need a diversion from the endless stream of bad news and political arguments so in honor of that lost trip and everyone's lost trips this year so I feel compelled to write a list.

20 favorite countries to travel through.

(This got a bit out of hand and is pretty long but you got something better to do than read a love letter to some of the best countries in the world?                  Didn't think so, Enjoy)

20)  Laos -  This unheralded little wedge of gorgeous makes you feel like you've been transported into a time before, a jungled world of neck bending landscapes and ox cart commerce. The capital Vientiane is an afternoon reverie often found half collapsing into the endless brown chug of the Mekong, the essential provincial capital of culture Luang Prabang upstream is a meditation in motion, its colonial melange richly preserved and active still. I hear it's changed a lot since I was there but Vang Vieng, set amongst the splendor of mystical limestone karst mountains is/was a hub of debaucherous tubing adventures that will test your liver's ability to process alcohol and your bodies ability to be flung from homemade slides and rope swings.

19)  Norway - This astounding Scandinavian gem is filled with natural wonder. The soaring frozen peaks flanking the stunning waterfall filled fjords will leave you breathless and basking in awe. Bergen, the North Sea facing Viking launchpad time capsule, and the fjordlands around it perfectly captured the Valhalla visions that I had in my mind. Drink from the one of the hundreds of crystalline waterfalls pouring from almost every mountain top, dance on a cliffs edge above yawning canyons, skydive into pretty little Voss, camp out under the most stars you've ever seen in the hinterland, go way over budget everywhere you go. 

18)  Cambodia - This country somehow emerged from absolute tragedy to be possibly the nicest, happiest, most welcoming population in the world. It's one of the poorest countries I've been to and yet the people were some of the richest in spirit that I've ever met. Angkor Wat is an astounding monument to ancient ingenuity and scale, just get lost in that sprawling achievement for days then party in Siem Reap all night with your new best friends from the hostel. The endless rice field filled countryside forces inner contemplation, the devastating Khmer Rouge memorials will shake you to your core and the relaxed old colonial towns of Sihanoukville and Kampot will make you feel right at home. Everything here is incredibly cheap so you can journey for a long time on a small budget but be sure to volunteer if you can and give something back. 

17)  Chile -  This long spit of land between the South Pacific and the Andes Mountains has adventure in its DNA. From the far north high deserts of Atacama to the ridiculously rugged dreamland of Patagonia in the far south there is a lot to dig deep into. I had the most surreal bike journey of my life riding alone for 12 hours through the Valle de la Luna with a pack of wild dogs and a head full of Cactus magic. Santiago is a buzzing capital city full of beautifully run down colonial mansions and incredible cuisine. Valparaiso is the cultural capital by the sea that promises an artistically resonante experience.  

16)  Switzerland - It's as beautiful as they say it is and actually much more so. The Swiss Alps and all the pristine villages and towns spread throughout them are basically perfect expressions of the world done right. They've mastered the art of living well and have been blessed with one of the most spectacular landscapes imaginable to indulge all their hot cheese dippin desires in. Zurich is a picture perfect fairytale capital city on a pristine lake, same goes for the smaller towns of Lucerne, Interloken and so many other gems.  One of the best days of my life was taking the gondola to the base of the Matterhorn then sprinting for 8 hours back down to Zermatt. I passed through medieval villages in the glades, stopping for fondue and snacks whenever I needed to, with that towering, magnificent pyramid always keeping watch right over my shoulder. The only real drawback is the insultingly high prices of everything. $30 burgers and $200 2 hour train rides are just outrageous.

15)  Egypt -  I arrived in Egypt right before the revolution and landed smack dab in the middle of Ramadan, so I experienced a very tense Cairo. I found a lot of the people to be aggressive and dismissive, touts and scammers kept trying to get over on me, and a manic energy streamed through the streets that gave me anxiety. None of that mattered though as I walked through the massive Egyptian museum dumbfounded and stress ceased to ever exist as I danced giddy on the tippy top of the Queen's pyramid and laid triumphantly in Khafre's sarcophagus deep within the Great Pyramid of Giza.

14)  France - The cultural treasures of France are as well known as a baguette with fromage on it but it's fame in no way diminishes its glory and seeing the life affirming masterpieces contained within its borders is a prerequisite for a well traveled life. Paris is simply Paris, the cultural behemoth of nearly everyone's dreams. You just have to go there and give it all the time and energy you can muster. Provence in the south is a place so idyllic, so picturesque, so potent with poetry that just saying it's name causes you to swoon slightly into a delirious dream of living the good life. The French Alps are glorious and often call to me in my dreams. Annecy in the foothills has such a fairy tale quality that it feels like it should only exist in Epcot and Chamonix beneath towering Mont Blanc may just be the most perfect mountain town on Earth. 

13)  Nicaragua - This often overlooked country is a great place for an affordable adventure. It's rocky past and unstable political situation scare most people away but once you get there you quickly realize its a stunning lineup of volcanic pleasures.  There is literally a line of giant volcanoes running down its west coast that fill the place with a rumbling kinetic energy that invigorates. Grab a volcano board in charismatic Leon and slide down Cerro Negro, stroll through lovely Granada then monkey around in a treehouse on Mombacho, slip into island time on Ometepe, twin volcanos that are exploding out of an inland sea, explore the deep jungles around El Castillo, then have a beach party in San Juan del Sur. This little country has a lot and it all conspires to make for an exemplar adventure destination. 

12)  Australia -  The land way down under is an alternate universe where perfect beaches and murderous wildlife collide in an epic continent filled with the bizarre and the sublime. A great place for a dangerously long outback road trip, a surprisingly easy cross country hitchhike, or a backpacker hostel party tour with all the cool kids from Canada and Europe. Come for the laid back fun loving vibes, stay because you got eaten alive by a saltwater crocodile. 

11)  Portugal -  Best weather, most affordable and often cooler than anywhere else in Western Europe, Portugal checks a whole lot of boxes including the one that says ""would you live here"". Lisbon is special city by the sea with several distinct, vibrant districts, each filled with mazy appeal, sociality and charming architecture. Nearby Sintra is a storybook castle town that swells your soul with its surrealismo palaces and whimsical gardens. Coimbra is captivating and Porto is a pleasure. The people are exceptionally kind and inviting, the food is delicious and the energy in the air is a feeling of seize the day jollivity.

10) Ecuador -  This little hot pocket of extraordinary experiences packs a heavy punch for such an underrepresented destination. Nearly everything that Latin America offers can be found neatly tucked away somewhere within it's borders. From atmosphere scraping peaks that you can barge down on a mountain bike, to the thickest of Amazon rainforests, from all day all night beach paradises, to exciting world heritage cities filled with living well, you can find quite a lot here. Then there's the Galapagos Islands, which stand alone on planet Earth with their absolutely bursting at the seams cornucopia of exotic wildlife, unsettlingly active landscapes and their gift of sheer existential thrill when you're on the ocean floor surrounded by two dozen unique species and you realize you're just another weird animal in this cacophonic symphony of survival.

9)  Turkey -  I didn't really know that much about Turkey before I went there, and the longer I was the there the more I learned that I knew even less than I thought. Istanbul is one of those big time, headliner, world class cities that lets you know immediately just how damn important it is and has been for a very long time. There is a powerful gravitas there, a vortex of history and power and iron dense culture that billows out from Sultanahmet and cloaks half of the near east in its influence. As you follow that flow and travel around the country you learn an undertold history of the world, see it with your own eyes and absorb it into your soul. The ancient subterranean cities of Cappadocia, the cliff cave churches of Goreme, the windy macadamia world of the Black Sea coast, the ruins of Troy and Ephesians, the games of backgammon in a teahouse in Sakarya.

8)  Mexico -  Even after I had traveled around the world and back I still had a nagging prejudice to and fear of Mexico. I guess being told it was an incredibly dangerous country my whole life made me believe it and when I was on that first one way flight to Mexico City I genuinely thought I might be placed directly on a guillotine after passing through customs. To my happy surprise, not only was I not kidnapped for my organs, I actually fell in love with the country, it's people, it's culture and just about everything else about it. I've been there many times now, traveling through huge swaths of the country and have never once felt like I was in danger. On the contrary I've always felt my spirits soar and been supremely invigorated by it's hip swaying charisma. The Yucatan is a vacation dream come true, from Holbox to Tulum and Isla Mujeres to Campeche you can't lose on the lush limestone thumb. The jungles, mountains and pyramids of Chiapas are captivating, the beaches and towns of Oaxaca are exceptional and that big brash metropolis, DF, Mexico City is one of the finest, most vibrant, swinginest lil pueblos this side of el Atlántico. 

7)  Thailand -  A lot of tourists become backpackers in Thailand. It's like a training ground for independent world travel and it's also easily one of the best places you will ever go. Just spectacular from top to bottom this place is what adventure dreams are made of. Some of the most striking, jagged, glorious islands in the world surround the mainland beckoning the young jet setter with their actually perfect white sand beaches, full moon ragers and underwater technicolor menagerie. Bangkok is a full throttle, ancient meets future kick in the crotch, Chang Mai is a medieval capital of cool that makes you want to start house hunting immediately and tiny Pai in the hills is a bubble of end of the world communal (esque) living that you may never want to leave. Buzzing around this country on a scooter is one of life's great pleasures. 

6)  Peru -  Machu Picchu has brought hoards to the land of the Incas and rightfully so, it's the most incredibly set and lavishly constructed monument to the ancient world this space rock ever manifested. The rest of Incadom is really freaking great as well. Cuzco is one of the best cities in the America's for many reasons. It's architecture is an awesome blend of pre columbian, no mortal, massive boulder construction and Spanish colonial plasterwork. The food is a wild blend of history and deeply divergent societies, the circus of life playing out in the streets is endlessly entertaining and the nightlife is rocking. Lima is a world class city with a lot of life, the Andes are insane, the Amazon is thick, the tiny oasis of Huacachina is a dream, the Nazca lines will blow your mind and the surf nirvana of Mancora is a place you will probably want to stay for as long as you can.

5)  Italy -  Ciao Bella! As soon as you make it to Italy you know exactly where you are. The once capital of the universe, the leading light that brought the world out of Medieval darkness, the suavest, swankiest, classiest and best living country in the world. The dulce vita is such a sultry, divine way to live and how could you not under that Tuscan Sun, in the shadows of empires in the hills of Rome, wading through the labyrinth of Venice, engaging with the masters of art in Florence, clinging to a cliffside in unreal Cinque Terre, or getting lost in the Roman time warp of Pompeii.  It's almost all too much but I doubt I could ever have enough. I know I have Italian heritage and maybe its cliche to say it, but this place just feels like home.

4)  Guatemala -  There is a certain magic about Guatemala that is hard to explain and impossible to understand until you've been there. I think it's because of the very present and ubiquitous influence of the Mayans that still fills this country. That indigenous force fills this lush, stunning world of mountain lakes and volcanoes and pyramids and everything else here that seems to be reaching into the heavens to thank God for all this glory. I loved Antigua, a beautiful colonial city under a towering volcano, I deeply love the hidden kingdom of Lago de Atitlan and San Pedro, I love Lanquin and the crystal falls of Semuc Champey, Tikal is tremendous and I love Guatemala.

3)  Spain -  This is the country that I would most want to live in outside of the States, particularly in Barcelona, my overall favorite city on Earth. The world's best blend of high and low culture, beach and mountain, art and architecture. The food, the music, the international bouquet of life that pulses through its largely carless streets. The Dalismo dream state that entrances the carousing Catalans and every waylaid voyager who gets swept up in its magic. It makes me feel like everyday is the best day of my life so I better start acting like it. The festive spirit that runs through Spain speaks directly to my ever swaying soul. Its the joie de vivre (or should i say alegría de vivir?) that pervades the Spanish world that is just so intoxicating, so enamoring it makes me want to dance flamenco in the streets!  There are so many highlights, from sashaying Sevilla, to glorific Granada, magnetic Madrid to green Gijon and definitely cool as hell Donostia. The mosque in Cordoba is tremendous, the pilgrimage final stop cathedral in Santiago de Compostela will bring you to your knees, the futuristic complex in Valencia will wow you. There is a whole lot here to unpack. I want to go back, and maybe next time for good. 

2)  Colombia -  All the way down Central America people kept telling me, just wait til you get to Colombia, just wait til you get to Colombia and they weren't lying. This is the king of Latin America as far as I'm concerned and one of the countries that I can't wait to go back to. Cartagena brought me in and immediately made me anxious about leaving, like a book you're in the middle of but you already don't want it to end. A beautiful town just bursting at the bricks with character and vitality. Down the coast I tucked into Taganga, my favorite little just barely off the radar traveler enclave, and stayed put for almost a month. Hiking 5 days into the thickest of mountain jungles to find the lost city of the never conquered Tayrona people was and still is one of the best things i've ever and probably will ever do. Caving and class 5 rafting in San Gil is sick as, Medellin is the shit, Bogota is way up there and Salento in the lushiest chartreuse Suess fantasy landscape ever made, a true rare earth heaven. Also trudging through the Amazon for 2 hours to find a tribal dance party deep in the jungle will live everlasting in my heart. I must get back to Colombia as soon as the world allows me to.

1)  Indonesia -  I really love Indo because its got almost everything I like in spades. The best beaches and beneath the sea, mind melting mountainscapes, rich cultural offerings that seem to ring from every angle, delicious cuisine, and just so unbelievably affordable. I could see myself settling down on one of those rapturous islands at some point in my life for sure. All places give off a vibe, an energy that I feel the second I get there, and Indonesia gives off a different one for every island, each inviting and intriguing in its own way. Bali filled me with a exuberance, a feeling that shook me inexplicably giddy straight off the plane and led me through it's templed worlds and hedonistic delights. Lombok and the Gili islands gave me pure peace, a feeling of easy living in the sun or shade, lazy unwanting days where a hammock and a book are guilt free ecstasy and the rest of the world can wait. Java felt like ecstatic animistic energy pulsing between every plant, rock, animal and object connecting each to another, its a shivering earth shattering geothermal power that quakes just beneath, it's salt and sea and peak and valley, it's manic commercialism and astounding population density . There's still so many islands there I haven't even seen yet and maybe that's another reason why it rises so high in my memory, because I have unfinished business on that archetypal archipelago. I see paradise in my mind when I think about it so it gets the top spot.

So there you go, 20 of my favorite countries that I would love to go back to any time and hope I'll get the chance to again.

249,2021-03-17T09:31:23Z,0.0,m70ggx,t3,question,0.0,"I (23F) wanted to share my quite frustrating, and frankly oppressive experience with Airbnb yesterday - and see if anyone else has had a similar issue. To give you some background, I've had an account on the app since 2016; I am the English speaking co-host for a listing in Istanbul, and have stayed at a fabulous Airbnb in Cancun (as we preferred being farther from the resort party zone, and have subsequently received a glowing review for). I was meant to stay at an Airbnb for a trip to Paris, but unfortunately had to cancel as it was for around the time when the pandemic broke out. I have always valued the flexibility, UI, and just sheer humanity of the Airbnb concept - and due to the trust mechanisms, it was usually my first choice when looking for accommodation abroad.

None of this was, however, was reflected in my experience yesterday. After spending hours researching the perfect price for value listing (a tiny house in Austin) for a 2-person staycation planned in one week, I reached out to the host for clarification on some questions. The host, Olivia, promptly answered my questions and based on my profile, granted a pre-approval to book. Despite having this pre-approval, Airbnb's algorithm ultimately restricted me from booking entire homes on my account - from what I and the support team gathered to be based on age, living in the same city as the listing, planning a trip in the short (?) span of a week, and only having one review as a traveler. And upon further trial, what I found is that it didn't matter how far in advance I tried to book an entire home, nor if the listing is in a city different than mine - I am effectively barred from booking entire homes. When I reached out to support, who were trying to be helpful, but unable to provide anything more than vague details about this restriction, were ultimately unable to lift it. Not only did I get no notification from airbnb about this restriction being placed on my account, I only made this restriction discovery once I was at the payment stage of my booking. The worst part is that there is no way to redeem your account be it through traditional/alternative methods, such as a credit check.

And Airbnb's take-it-or-leave-it alternative - in the middle of a potentially fatal and contagious pandemic - is to to stay at a shared apartment with strangers, or to stay at a potentially crowded/pricy hotel. If Airbnb thinks this purely automated, and frankly oppressive method of sweeping restrictions is going to crack down on partiers - it probably will. But it will also mean that they will lose young, frequent users like myself who valued the very core concept of renting a home away from home, isolating during a pandemic, and finding gems of places to stay all over the world.

TLDR If anyone has figured a way around this restriction, be it through by reached out to Airbnb itself, please do let me know!",travel,Airbnb restriction on young users?,0.0,0.36
250,2021-03-16T17:40:14Z,0.0,m6k6c2,t3,question,6.0,"I'm planning on going to Egypt &amp; Jordan in March 2022 with my partner, and I'm and starting to put together a day by day itinerary to plan out costs, etc. We'll be flying in from the west coast of USA, so we're taking it relatively easy for the first week to deal with jet lag.

Sunday 07/11 - Pick up a car from the airport and drive down to the Keys.

For this leg I want to go to a nice resort, preferably with a beach. Ideally I'd like to be somewhere where I can easily drive around in the day, but where i'd be able to go somewhere for a meal and a drink in the evening and get an Uber back. So a central location that isn't in the middle of nowhere. I'd like to visit Theatre of the Sea, Bahia Honda State Park, and maybe do some nice boat trips.

As a kid I stayed at the Marina del Mar in Key Largo.

Friday 12/11 - Drive down to Key West.

I'd like to do a weekend in Key West, see the sights, get on the trolley tour and do some drinking. I couldn't believe the prices so any recommendations of somewhere towards the West of the Island with free parking would be great. I know i'll be paying over £1000 for the weekend, happy to pay it but just want recommendations on the best value.

Sunday 14/11 - Leave Key West

Have the full day in Key West and then travel to a last spot to chill out on our way back up to Miami airport. Here i'm open to suggestions on timings, do I need more time in Key West to enjoy everything it has to offer?

Is there another part of the Keys I should consider staying at that's different to my first leg?

Tuesday 16/11 - Fly home from Miami airport in the late afternoon.

Spend the morning at the Keys and then drive back to the airport in the afternoon.

September 27:  arrive in FRA early morning.  Take noon flight to Bologna, then train to Florence.

Oct 1:  late afternoon train to Venice after 2 days Bologna.

Oct 3: train to Ljubljana.  Option is early train with half day stopover in Trieste vs. later train.  Leaving early means only 1+ days Venice.

How are Saint Martin beaches (specifically Orient Bay) compared to Aruba beaches?

How is driving in Saint Martin?

Are there enough cheap eats and grocery stores on the French side?

I think the pandemic has also exacerbated a growing feeling I had about travel as well, that I want to slow down and spend much longer in getting to know a place to travel more meaningfully...

When I say ""beginner,"" what I mean is someone who has never been to the Caribbean (actually I've never been out of the country), is pretty naive and clueless about travel and tourism, and does not know what I will enjoy and what I won't. (I'm not sure if I will be more of a gambling kind of guy, or a snorkeling person, or someone who just really likes relaxing on the beach and doing nothing, or someone who is really obsessed with going to every single restaurant, etc.).

Let's say that you just want a good mix of things in a place that is beginner-friendly. Also, I'm a solo traveler. Probably going for five or six days within the next month or so. Let's also assume for the sake of this discussion that budget is not an issue (I've never really vacationed before, so I don't mind spending a bunch of money...and I don't expect any place in the Caribbean to be particularly cheap).

What's a ""newbie-friendly"" Caribbean island? What is a good introduction point to Caribbean culture, all the various things I can do on a Caribbean vacation, etc.?

We are now considering a similar one-year, round-the-world trip with our children, and we are thinking about the best time to plan such an adventure, for maximum enjoyment and benefits for the entire family.

Some of the things we are taking into consideration in terms of the age of our children are:

• The age of our oldest child, ideally aiming for before teenage years.

• The age of our youngest child, ideally aiming for a time when such a trip would be enjoyable for everyone (for instance: traveling with a newborn may not be our preferred option).

• School years/grades of our children, making sure none of them is disadvantaged by the trip (for instance missing a fundamental/milestone/pivotal year).

We are also taking into consideration our own age, ideally aiming for a time when we are still in good shape, physically.

In other words, there are many variables to consider, which opens many different options, and we would love to learn from your experience, good or bad, traveling with kids, when they appreciate the adventure the most, when it is the most challenging, etc.

My 11 year old son has decided he wants to see the Expo in Dubai next February. I've already found a nice hotel which I've booked (not a chain I have loyalty for, so I've used Hotels.com for the rewards).

I realise it's still very early, but I've been looking at flights, as I've been having trouble finding flights from near me that give me the maximum time possible at destination, but I've found a direct itinerary with Emirates that fits perfectly.

Used Skyscanner, as I do, to find the itinerary, and found ""TravelTrolley"" quoted nearly GBP100 cheaper than direct with the Airline, and I can book it right in Skyscanner!

Normally, I book airfare directly with the airline. We'll be flying basic Y.

I'm happy with the Emirates price, but obviously a £100 saving will upgrade my hotel room!

Thing is, when I tried to book directly with EK, they didn't have flights open for my dates yet - possibly another 2 weeks, but the OTA appear to be able to offer it, and are also claiming I can have a couple of checked bags, so it's even cheaper!

How can they offer this fare now? Is it a special Travel Agent price? Is it supposed to be sold with a package?

More importantly, should I be wary and hold on until EK are open?

I *can* book the flights I want with Emirates as part of a package, but their package price is more than flight+hotel separately, so I'd rather not go down that route.",travel,How are the OTAs able to sell before the airline? Should I buy now or wait? Flying to Dubai.,1.0,0.67

I had 4 flights, and two of them didn’t work out. 

I had a connecting flight from Denver to Orlando, and then from Orlando to San Juan. By the time the plane landed in Orlando I had 5 mins to reach my connecting flight to Puerto Rico! So I sprinted like a mf to the gate and realized the plane had left without me in it! They knew I was at the airport but they still decided that I qualified as a “no-show” and therefore I don’t get a refund. 
 
So I had to book a flight through southwest to get to Puerto Rico. A 300$ additional flight! 

Now for the way back, my time ends in Puerto Rico, I board my flight from Puerto Rico to Fort Lauderdale. As I’m landing in Fort Lauderdale I see an email stating that my flight from Fort Lauderdale to Denver was cancelled. They offered a flight 3 days later......since I have a job, that wasn’t going to work for me, so again I booked another flight, this time for almost 800$. 

Spirit airlines states that you can get a refund in their email they sent me for the cancelled flight to Colorado. When I call that number it doesn’t work....so I google the spirit airlines customer service number and call that. It just sends me a text message and I have to chat through WhatsApp to communicate with people. Who tell you can’t get a refund even though they state it in the email they send out to you. 

Spirit airlines is a joke! Who’s with me and would like for them to go bankrupt and never use their service ever again?

My issues are that 1) the further out the better for obvious reasons and 2) because of nursing school she has barely any free time.

I'm referring only to the birth certificate requirements, not to what I should write in the application itself. Some birth certificates provide more details than others. If by place of birth they mean an address then I would need a long-form birth certificate. If they mean county or city then my current short-form birth certificate will suffice as proof of citizenship.

\*\*\*

ORIGINAL POST

It's my first time applying for a passport. To prove your citizenship with a birth certificate, the State Department's site states you can use a...

[U.S. birth certificate](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/citizenship-evidence.html#ExternalPopup) that meets the following requirements:

* Issued by the city, county, or state of birth
* Lists applicant’s full name, date of birth, and place of birth
* Lists parent(s)’ full names
* Has the signature of the city, county, or state registrar
* Has the date filed with registrar's office (must be within one year of birth)
* Has the seal of issuing authority

How specific do they mean by ""place""? My birth certificate shows county of birth, but not a hospital address for instance. It meets all other listed requirements.

I got a ride to the airport (I’ll call my friend who drove me Dave) so I didn’t have to park my car at the airport, which is what normal people do. I got to the airport at about 4:30—right on time for my 6:35 flight. 

Fast forward ten minutes. Now I’m standing in line at TSA, and I realize that I don’t have my wallet. My first thought was that I had placed it in my backpack. I checked, and it wasn’t there. I knew I had my wallet in my car, and I likely had dropped it in the car, so I wasn’t too worried.

Waited fifteen minutes for Dave to get back, and found my wallet on the floor next to my seat, right where it would have been if it had fallen out of my pocket. I had everything now, I was good to go.

Unfortunately, that was NOT the case. My phone, no cap, literally fell out of my pocket as I was leaning over to grab my wallet. When I realized this, I started laughing my head off. I was like “I’ll live, who cares.” The other people I was traveling with were not as amused with my misfortune.

I waited 15 minutes and then texted Dave that  (with my friends phone, not mine, as i did not have my phone at this point) and asked him to give it to a buddy of mine who was flying down to stay with me two days later.

Five minutes after, I got a call from Dave. He was like “Bro your phones not in here.” I laughed, and was like guess I’m buying a new one. Thankfully, the people I’m traveling with aren’t degenerates, and they suggested I simply use Find My iPhone.

I logged in, and located my phone on the road right where I’d dropped it. I exited the airport, less than an hour before my flight at this point, and walked to where I’d dropped my phone. (I would have jogged, but I have grade 2 sprains in the same ligament in both ankles from basketball. The second of which occurred during a practice while I was on crutches for the other one, wearing Nike slides, and NOT supposed to be practicing.)

Literally 50 yards before I got to the spot where my phone was, I got a notification on my friends phone saying someone had located my phone. I was like bruh you’re kidding, now I have to track down a moving target. 

Thankfully, they handed it to a security guard, and it was just sitting on a table by the front door, so I was able to easily retrieve it. I made my way back through TSA for the second time on my third attempt, with 30 minutes to spare before my flight.

I am sitting on the plane now, waiting for takeoff, and as far as I know, I didn’t lose anything new (though with my track record so far today, I probably did. I’ll update y’all when my flight lands.)

If I learned anything, it’s that I should get better pockets, which I guess means I learned nothing because I already knew my pockets were horrible. Additionally, I learned that I am way calmer under pressure than the people I’m traveling with. 

To quote my senior quote, “If nobody’s laughing, than what am I getting hurt for?” (For context, I play three sports, and the running joke in all of them is that I’m always injured, which I am, even currently. That definitely applies here. 

Laugh at my misfortune. It’s why I’m here. I command you to laugh.

Would you like to own a house somewhere in spain/italy as a vacation home? 

I ask because, pls don't laugh, there are many houses to sell for 1$, not in the main cities but still in villages close to beaches etc. But there is the obligation to renovate it within three years. So ik people wouldn't want to manage renovating from the other side of the ocean. 

Thus I was thinking it might be a business idea, to sell the house + renovating as a service. Sort of a european real estate consultancy for internationals.

Edit: Should probably specify I ll give an example. You could get a house in south of Sicily, it's about 20 miles away from the main city Palermo (airport), and approx 5 miles away from the beach.

As you can probably see from my non existing reddit karma, I'm a complete newbie to reddit and also to this subreddit. I was lurking around here for way too long and finally decided to join, yay! Gotta love some travel inspiration, especially these days when we can't go anywhere really.

I was having this discussion with my friend the other day about taking a trip before it is 'too late' or before our time or opportunity to do so runs out. I love traveling and I also looove discussing about the different aspects of it, like what motivates some people to do it (I guess in general I like to dig deep into every subject). We were chatting about how people might want to visit some places now instead of later for different personal reasons. Both me and my friend had slightly different points of view. I would like to travel as much as possible while I'm young, have no mortgage, kids, etc., but I don't really care where to, like I don't have any bucket lists really. His POV was kinda different and he was mostly interested in very specific places and seeing them before it's too late (as the places could soon become too tourist-y).

Our motto is 'walk two blocks, turn left, then eat'. Also, if the menu is laminated and/or has multiple languages on it, keep walking. This particular time, after visiting the Roman Forum, we didn't follow our own advice.

That day we were enticed by a very very old man sitting on a chair outside a place not far from the Forum. With a quavery voice in Italian he beckoned us in. This was far from a typical tout so we went down a few steep steps into a tiny dining room and are seated under a weak A/C and next to the toilette. Despite the locale it felt very 'family' and we were not disappointed. We request our lunchtime usual bottle of sparkling water and a half liter of wine and are told we're getting bread and tomatoes, then we order. Next to us, the only other people in the tiny room, are a fat man in his 30s or 40s, a woman we take to be his mother, and a little white dog under the table. Turns out they're part of the family. After eating their pasta mom disappears and the guy, without turning his head, is growling into the kitchen. He's brought a large plate of sliced fruit. He puts two slices of melon on mom's plate and eats the rest. While this is going on Nonno, the very frail old man from outside, is assisted in for his plate of pasta at another table, napkin tied around his neck. Mom comes back, eats her melon, ties the dog up next to Nonno, disappears again, and sonny boy next to me falls asleep in his chair for the next half hour. Eventually he wakes up and disappears. I didn't notice when Nonno left but he was gone and we're now left alone with an unhappy dog, leash twisted around the chair. Brad fixed the dog leash, we study the photos on the wall (noting one who we recognize as the fat man when he was much younger and fitter confirming the family connection), we both pet the dog, we're handed free limoncello and the bill, and sent on our way.

So my friend is doing camp America this year and at the end of his time at camp me (24M) and another friend of ours are planning on meeting him in California for 2 weeks. 

We’ll be flying from London in late August / early September and we want to spend time in LA, San Francisco and camp in Yosemite. 

Non of us are really sure how best to a-lot our time and we’re pretty flexible with what we do and how long we spend in each place, just looking for the best experience. 

We’d like to explore generally but also do as many of the following activities as possible: 

-Flying lesson over the coast 
-Diving tour 
-Wine tasting in Napa Valley 
-Surfing 
-Some white water rafting / rock climbing type stuff 

We don’t intend on renting a car so to go between San Fransisco and LA we plan to either get a greyhound bus or fly, but probably the bus as we can do this overnight and it saves us a nights board. 

Does anyone have any suggestion on the route, would it be better to fly into LAX or somewhere in SF? We’re aiming to spend a maximum of £2.5k including flights.

Also any recommendations for bars and in particular Jazz clubs would be greatly appreciated.",travel,California route and advice,4.0,0.83

Obviously we can make anywhere work, but we both appreciate great beer and wine, so I wouldn't want to go somewhere like Germany or Napa where I'd feel like not being able to imbibe would feel like a huge bummer/like I wasn't fully experiencing the place, even if there is other non-drinking options aplenty. Has anyone visited Georgia that can weigh in, or if you have any other thoughts I'd love to hear them!

For context, somewhere without a heavy drinking culture like Northern Africa or the Middle East would be great, as would a more rustic adventure type trip like Patagonia or Iceland. I've done a bunch of that but just for context.

Travel has been my dream since I was a kid reading National Geographic and all about the Discovery Channel. I used to create scrapbooks and bucket lists of all the places I would go. I have been lucky enough travel to Thailand twice for 6 months total, Japan twice for about 6 weeks total. A weekend in Malaysia(Thai visa extension) and a long weekend in New Caledonia. 

I live in New Zealand and I believe there are some countries that might let me in for a holiday, however getting back into NZ would just be too difficult. I have a job and house and cat I have to come back to and when I return from holiday I would have to pay $5000 for 2 weeks in an isolation hotel. Not to mention the rooms in the isolation hotels are booked out months in advance and are really only intended for people doing essential travel. 

A few years I gave work 2 weeks notice and booked my flight to Thailand. 2019 I booked 2 weeks in Japan with about a month notice. My return flight landed Sunday night and I was back at work on Monday morning. Travel was so easy. So simple. I lived on a whim. I wanted to go somewhere, I could just go. For me travel was accessible, an adventure and an escape. When I travel I feel like I am living my childhood dreams.

We both are party types, but I would like this destination to be a place with a lively party scene but one that you can optionally participate in. The last destination we met in was Cancun, and it was a little too much(as well as too much of a tourist trap for me) and we ended up failing to communicate by the end because we were both so hungover and sleep deprived by the end. 

I was thinking of Peru for this trip, as it's one of the few popular tourist destinations in South America that I haven't been to, but I'm wondering if it's a bit too tame in terms of nightlife options and too heavy on the outdoor/hiking aspect. Also it doesn't have beaches, which has been a feature in the last couple places we have been. Although I like walking around in cool Spanish architecture cities, not sure if I'm the type who wants to spend the entire time walking around and taking pictures of random things all day with no other options.

519,2021-03-05T13:19:04Z,0.0,lyi9bg,t3,question,30.0,"Hey! 

I will try to explain the plan of mine as well as the details I have already planned in order for you to get a better picture of what I am trying to achieve. 

In the summer of 2022 (around June-July) I would like to fulfill one of my lifelong dreams - a trip to the United States. I am currently a citizen of Lithuania, a small country in Europe, the Baltic region. 

The group of travelers would consist of me and my 5 friends, totaling 6 people. 

Let's start off with the plan that is currently in my head:

1. Fly to NYC and rent a car there. Stay 3 nights there visiting all the sights and having a little bit of fun by going out. 
2. Head to Washington and stay a night or two there. 
3. Head to Chicago, spend few nights there. 
4. Travel across the US by making stops at various cities, sleeping in the motels until we reach Las Vegas, then, spend 2 nights there (of course visiting the Grand Canyon). 
5. Arrive in Los Angeles and spend around 5 nights there, chilling and visiting sights. 
6. Final destination - San Francisco. A couple of nights there, then a flight back to Lithuania. 

I haven't still decided what exactly should we visit during the Chicago - Las Vegas stretch, but that is definitely yet to come! 

The duration of the trip - 3 weeks (is that even enough?). 

I have also done a rough route-planning using Google Maps: 

[The route we would follow during the trip](https://preview.redd.it/pfz4mn4n19l61.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f49e30e3027069622d639fb981968f82c3c94b)

Current budget planning: 

* Plane tickets: \~550 euros for a person to both sides. 
* Car rental: 4000 euros (700 euros per person) for 22days (**Dodge Grand Caravan**, checked at **Alamo**), 2 drivers aged below 25 (24-22 y/o) attaching screenshot:

[The car we are planning to take](https://preview.redd.it/nsteu0o729l61.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c17ea731b94022ffaa313e04d02cc98320039719)

* Fuel: estimated 12 liters / 100km and for roughly 6500km, it would total to 500euros roughly, so 85 euros per person \~ 
* Prepaid SIM card with unlimited data (20days) - 35 euros (*it is always nice to have that data!*)
* Hotels - 40 euros per night (**person**) (on average, given the fact that motels could turn out cheaper and in LA it would be more expensive. I am mostly looking for a place near downtown, with better reviews and a place to park a car. So, it would total to 880 euros for a person. 
* Visa - **150 euros?** 
* Leisure time/food - 60 euros a day, 1300 for a whole trip. 

That brings my total estimate of money I would spend to: **3500euros**, but adding that 500 in order to be in the safe spot, so **4000 euros**. 

# Now, my questions are as follows: 

1. Is there anything you could advise that can be done cheaper or any suggestions to improve in general? 
2. Are my estimates roughly correct? 
3. What about car rental - is it a good choice to rent a car for 22 days for such a price, or are there any options to rent a Minivan for a lower price or in general, alternatives that would be more comfortable and cheaper? 
4. The Visa - is it hard to get it, and does it cost 150 euros indeed? 
5. Which motels are best to take? I have looked at **Motel 6**, and it looked fine. 
6. Are there any fees that I haven't taken into account that I should be aware of? 

Thank you for your suggestions and any comments are welcome, you will be extremely helpful!

Do you have any suggestions on where I should go? My interests weigh very heavily in the direction of unique and awe-inspiring natural landscapes, I love hiking and pretty much all outdoor activities like biking, skydiving, kayaking, etc., I like roughing it a little and going on more adventure type trips in unusual places with a lot packed in. I do love big cities but I’m looking to visit somewhere truly unique if I go to a major metro. I’m not a complete idiot usually but it would be my first time traveling internationally in places where I do not speak the local language, so there might be some risks/scams/obstacles that more experienced travelers would know about that I might not. I might also be traveling alone as a woman. Here are the main ideas I’ve had so far:


1. Argentina/Chile/Antarctica - my plan was to first go to Beunos Aires, explore a bit, go to Santiago/Valparaiso, explore a bit, then hang out in Ushuaia and see if I can get a discounted trip to Antarctica for around a week. If not, I would just explore the Tierra del Fuego area for that week instead.


2. Italy/Morroco/Algeria - I was thinking of doing a little Mediterranean thing, which felt like the safer option since I could probably convince someone to come with me and things aren’t as remote. I would spend maybe 1.5 weeks in Italy (Venice/Milan/Dolomites/Almalfi Coast), then a few days in Algiers and surrounding coast before going for a quick peek in Marrakesh and a little rural Morocco action. 


3. Australia/NZ - This one would be good for me because I speak the language, but I also am really interested in the trip itself. I would like to visit Perth and southwestern Australia, then go to Cairns and possibly Sydney if I have time, and then go to NZ and likely spend almost all my time in the South Island (but if I’m lucky with time I would like to visit Auckland/Bay of Islands)


4. China/Hong Kong and Japan - I haven’t quite made up my mind about where I would go in these places, I just know that Tokyo and Osaka seem really interesting and different than what I’m used to, and parts of the Chinese countryside are ridiculously beautiful. 


Do yall have any other suggestions? Or any ideas on the trips I listed? I really appreciate any thoughts you have.

Apparently this site gives little or no support when things go wrong. Also they let people use rating systems for rents that happened long before the rating system was introduced. If one uses rarely but gets a bad rating they will never be able to properly use the site again regardless of side as their public profile would be ruined by that one “bad experience” reputation or in other words a big one star. 

I see the other competitor is twisted road. I never tried it but looking at its policies I see some that can be disturbing as well. Ie the site not the owner would collect $50 an hour or $300 a day late return fees that the owner won’t ever see the owner would only see daily rates should ride had been extended.

So I booked a flight a year ago. Today I got a refund for the entire booking from the airline itself. They processed it today (March 5). I let them know the card in file is not in use anymore, I have a new card linked to the account, and I asked to update information. They said I needed to reach out to the third party I booked with, CHEAP-O-AIR.

I reached out to COA. They said they hadn’t received word of a refund, so they wouldn’t be able to process on their end until they saw it. 

They also said I won’t be able to update info, the payment will be returned to the original card. The rep told me that the bank will see the refund, and they will have to transfer the funds. 

Has this happened to anyone?

The refund process was started by the airline just an hour or so ago, so I guess COA hasn’t had time to see it updated in their system yet. He told me to wait the seven business days.

I personally love a choppy ocean with decent waves to swim in. Obviously, not big surfing waves, but an ocean that has some waves that could really ruin your day if you aren't paying attention to the water. Not flat, calm water like some beaches have.

I read the water is more choppy in Cabo, but it's unswimmable? In that case, I would think Cancun is the default winner.

Like most of you I'm stuck at home planning some extended trips and I'm interested in seeing Eastern Europe during the Spring and Summer either next year or the year after.

As for myself, I'm an American with parents of different races. My dad is black, and my mom is white. I'd say my complexion is halfway between light and dark. The celebrity I look the closest to is either Xzibit or Jordan Peele of Key &amp; Peele. I've dealt with racism personally, I think the first time I realized I was different was when a kid said that my skin looked like shit in elementary school.

Not all of the countries in this list are considered Eastern European but these are the ones that I'm the most interested in visiting.

Ukraine, Hungary, Armenia, Croatia, Turkey, and Georgia.

The first question I find myself asking when looking into a country to visit is ""is this country racist like mine?""

Does anyone who knows Mexico well or has traveled in Mexico in September have any tips on (a) how bad the weather is in various parts of Mexico in September (b) suggestions for where to go?

I’d even be willing to go to Central America for better weather, but I assume most of those countries are in rainy season as well.

After international pleasure travel becomes a thing again, I'm planning to do a fair bit of it. I am looking into luggage as part of my advanced planing. 

When on vacation I typically travel with a 65 L duffel when I can't fit everything in a cary-on. This is fine domestically, but wheels really come in handy when going through customs, and a soft duffle is also not very secure against damage or pilfering. When traveling for business, I sometimes carry equipment in a Pelican, which gives a lot of piece of mind, but I'd feel like a weirdo larper carrying one on vacation.

90% of the rolling luggage I am finding online uses coil zippers (strangely even ""hard-sided"" luggage). IME these tend to fail quite regularly on all sorts of clothing and gear, which is why good packs/equipment use a tooth zippers rather than coil zippers. Also, I am concerned because they can be breached in seconds by poking them with a ballpoint pen.

I recently purchased a flight a couple months out through a travel site called Travomint.  It doesn't look to be a super popular site, but from what I could tell it looked perfectly legit, so I went with it as I found a great deal.

Anyway, I booked my flight roughly two weeks ago and have multiple confirmation emails from them.  I decided today to check my flight on the airline's website itself just for peace of mind, airline is Alaska.  When I put in my name and reference from Travomint, my departure date is 10 days later than what I chose through Travomint, 7 days after my return flight!  I am not sure what to do as Alaska's site clearly says no changes/no refunds for saver fair, and Travomint is dodging at the moment, and won't commit to a refund if they can't fix the flight.

I am wondering how long I should give them to ""look into the matter"".  So far they will not commit or entertain the idea of a refund if they cannot resolve the issue.  If they won't refund my ticket for a mistake that is clearly either theirs (or maybe Alaska's?) issue, can I dispute the charges with my bank?  Do I have any way to get my money back?

Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  Appreciate all the comments!  I get it I get it, book direct.  I did get in touch with Alaska, and thankfully got a super awesome agent who was sympathetic and changed my flight to the correct date, fare was the same.  Funny enough, the times of my corrected departure exactly matched my confirmation from Travomint.

For Yellowstone National Park - Can good spots be covered solely by driving ? I am sure we will be missing out on a lot of spots as we wont be able to walk a lot but is the car-only option viable to see at least a few good spots ?

We'd be keeping our jobs and working remotely, meaning that we'll generally need to put in regular workweeks on our laptops. To keep the travel time down, we were thinking of trying to rent furnished apartments for several weeks at a time in different hubs, living locally and sightseeing on evenings and weekends. We like city living and outdoor adrenaline/wildlife adventures. We have experience travelling around Europe, Australia, Canada and the US, but neither of us have ever been to Asia or Africa. We particularly want to see places that are best experienced during our (North American) winter, as we almost never get to travel at this time of year.

Here is our current, rough itinerary:

January: Auckland, New Zealand. I have a friend who lives here who I'd love to visit. Also seems like the perfect time of year for sea kayaking and scuba diving, and checking out Rangitoto Island.

February: Hanoi, Vietnam. I'm on the fence about whether to arrive in time for Tet, or skip it and arrive afterward. Thinking about visiting Mua Cave, and maybe take the train south on a weekend trip or two. 

March: Bangkok, Thailand. I was going to pick Chiang Mai, but from what I've read, it's too hot in March. Really into the possibility of seeing elephants at one of the national parks (Khao Yai?).

April: Jaipur, India. Like with Tet, I'm on the fence about whether to arrive in time for Holi or not.  Ranthambore National Park is top of the excursion list, for the tigers. Day or weekend train trips seem doable from here as well.

May: Marrakech, Morocco.  Ouzoud falls, Atlas mountains, and a weekend trip to see the Sahara.

Saw the post for Italy, and wanted to share what's happening in France, where it looks like things are going, and why the Summer will be more or less internal tourism only.

&amp;#x200B;

* France is in one of the worst situations in Europe right now, alongside the Czech Republic and Italy

What started out with France looking better-off than their neighbours Germany and Spain has turned into quite the opposite. As the Spanish and Germans start to think of Covid passports and opening-up, France is sinking into a deeper hole that we will once again struggle to climb out of.

The current hospital admissions is the highest since November, with a positive trend towards new potential highs. One way the death toll will remain low is that they have managed to vaccinate a high percentage of people in old people's homes and care facilities, but these new variants are taking over (the UK variant is nearing 50% of overall cases), and these variants are hitting younger people.

&amp;#x200B;

* The government is choosing inaction over prevention

It is a little known secret that the scientific council (they basically inform and advise the government and are the best experts the country has) recommended a lockdown for the entire month of February, which the government chose to ignore. We are now paying the price.

As a number of prefects and local elected officials scream for tighter measures, the government has said they will make decisions on March 6th (2 weeks from the announcement), as things were not bad enough yet for them to make decisions.

In the meantime, the curfew from 6PM to 6AM is still in place, but isn't really doing much, and it looks like we're at the beginning of a spike where the UK was before the Kent variant exploded and causes them to put the country into Level 5 full lockdown.

&amp;#x200B;

* We're not in lockdown, we're in a much worse situation than that

A lockdown is clear: stay home, essential businesses close, schools close, and we try to help alleviate the strain on the healthcare system.

In France, we don't have a lockdown: schools are fully open (bar universities), non-essential stores open, and people can go to the office (work from home is encouraged but in France, bosses don't like this, and a minority are doing it. In fact, employees don't like it either). However, we are not allowed out from 6AM to 6PM.

What does this mean?

You wake up, get the kids ready, drop them off at school, go to work, come home, rinse and repeat.

This causes masses of people gathering to go shopping on Saturdays, and a lot of people out on the weekends. They have now started weekend curfews to prevent this, and banned access to some areas that are notorious for people gathering, such as the riverbanks of the city of Toulouse, where people usually go to soak up the sun.

&amp;#x200B;

* Vaccine what now?

France, along with most of the EU, has failed the vaccine initiative. They lowballed the suppliers, going in with strict requirements and low prices, and not investing in research as much as the US or the UK.

Yes, there was a fund raiser with philanthropists in November 2020 raising 4b EUR, but that was private money, not EU money.

Yes, Germany invested in Biontech and France in Sanofi, but these were individual country decisions, not EU wide, and individual member state tax payer money, not EU money.

The result is that France has less than 3m vaccinated for a country of nearly 70m people, whilst the UK has nearly 20m first doses given. France, along with Germany, has also used only 50% of the delivered doses to the countries. Can you image that? There are 3m more doses sitting in fridges somewhere... what the F.

My mum had cancer (she got the all clear on Friday! :) ), she is at risk, and can get a vaccine now. She has a doctors prescription for one. I've called twice per day, each day, for six weeks to get her a vaccine. It is a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

* Tourism?

Restaurants are closed.

Bars are closed.

Evening curfew.

Weekend curfew nationwide is coming.

Last time this happened, France encouraged national tourism, opened up for foreigners mid-June, so maybe the summer will be saved, but I doubt it, because by the end of April, we'll be lucky to have 8m vaccinated, at this pace, it'll take the year to vaccinate enough people to open-up, especially with variants.

All in all, I cannot recommend coming here. First of all, because you will be adding to the problem that the government is creating by not making decisions and not providing vaccines, but also because you'll be very limited in scope and scale of what you can do.

On the other hand, I can see Portugal, Croatia and Greece doing a better job with managing tourism/measures/restrictions/etc.

This is why i decided to make this post to tell you about the current situation and also with a very cautious look into the recent future.

Of course i am no scientist and no expert, but i am a thinking person and making plan is one thing, but chosing the right time for them, is something else.

I am in the south, sicily. The place, where it is the hottest all year long and where summer starts in may. (make your own reasoning)

As for now i can tell you, that many people in hospitality have already postponed a possible start for the season from the regular easter time, to July.

IF they even open up the borders. Currently Italy is thinking of maybe allowing EU citizens to enter, non-EU seems to be out of question.

Some tourist guides and the tourist  association i needed to meet for work have painted a quite dark picture. Logically many customers have cancelled their summer trips and so some facilities have simply decided to not accept any bookings until june. also because they always lose money/rating if they decline or cancel. If they do, be aware that the cancel policy will probably be to your disadvantage.

The vaccination process is rather slow here. Even though i have a medical condition i might get it somewhen end-summerish (which in italy means winter, lol). This also means, that letting people enter is putting at risk the local population.

The politics tried to make it all seems under control but with the current change in power in the government, many things have been slowed down.

It isn't even allowed to cross regions at the moment and though it seemed to be lifted, it simply didn't but got worse, especially in the north.

Until now there have maybe been talks, but as it isn't sure that the first vaccine also helps against the new variants, being vaccinated doesn't change your right to enter.

So to save you time, money and nerves: think twice about your travel plans to italy this summer for some beaching in capri.

I know this isn't happy talk, but i hope i could provide some insight. And honestly, i think this applies to all of europe in the moment.\[sic\]",travel,For all of you who think of visiting italy in 2021,56.0,0.85

The goal of this post is to get everyone to share their favourite 'lesser known' sites/towns in Belgium that aren't on the obvious tourist trail. This has become a series I do on another sub but given how popular Belgium is I figured I'd also post this in the biggest travel sub so it can get more attention and we can all piggy back off everyone else's recommendations :). 

When looking at Belgium everyone knows of the big 4, Brussels (polarizing), Ghent, Bruge and Antwerp, and anyone who spends a few minutes researching Belgium would know of the beautiful cities of Tournai, Charleroi, the beautiful hilltop citadel and Dinant along the river, Namur, Liege and Leuven all for their historic centers. A special mention to Ypres for the historic value it provides from the battles fought in the area.

As we all know Belgium is a tiny compact country just chalked full of castles, monasteries and small historic towns, you can practically click any small town on google maps and find something worth a visit, but here are some of my personal favourites after spending a few hours researching Belgium (I'll also add a disclaimer, I have not visited Belgium, and this is all just from research I've done on the country).

Some lesser known sites I would like to visit would be:

Beauvoorde castle for it's fully furnished interior and historically accurate interior.

The historic town center of Tielt.

Disneyesque castle of Poeke Castle

A self guided walk or jog from Tournai to Antoing Castle an hour away. While walking you'll also pass by some old castle ruins (castle of Vaulx) at the halfway mark, and some small lowkey churches along the way.

A day trip to the small town of Binche.

A visit to the Aulne abbey near Chareloi

Base yourself out of Dinant to explore some castles along the Meuse river like Freyr castle, Crevecour castle ruins, Polivache castle ruins with a nice view of the river and landscape nearby. Also worth a visit to the Walzin castle and Veves castles to the south.

Small medieval town of Huy. For some reason it gives me some Eze, France vibes despite being completely different lol, either way it looks stunning.

Chimay castle

I could keep on going but I think you all get the idea. If you've been to Belgium share with us your favourite 'lesser known' sites, or share some sites you've heard of but haven't visited for yourself so others can check them out in the future.

I have time before starting a new job and I’m considering taking 4-6 days to fly into any feasible area in somewhat close proximity to a national park or just new natural environment to explore. I would likely be solo, open to staying at hotels, Airbnb’s, camping, etc. anywhere west of Utah, or possibly northeastern/eastern US. I’m not a crazily experience hiker as some, but am very comfortable with traveling, camping and hiking solo. I’d be hoping to travel last week of March/first week of April. Few things I’m considering:

- California or Utah major cities to fly into. I know Utah is filled with parks but not sure what might be best. 

- Would love to check out California, redwoods area or travel to crater lake (snow might be off putting, any insight would be great!) Airports in proximity to redwoods area looks limited. 

- I’d need to rent a car, this would probably be one of the most expensive parts of the trip, so keeping total miles down is a priority. 

- flying would seriously limit bringing any camping gear with me, how to best bring what I’d need on more of a shoestring budget?

We are trying to stay in the states. Firstly, because my fiancé doesn’t have her passport. while we can get it, it’s an expense we wouldn’t mind avoiding with all the wedding stuff going on. Also Who knows what will and won’t be available September 2021. 

We both love the outdoors. We love to hike, whether it be to overlooks, waterfalls or canyons we are all about it. We prefer warm to cold weather for sure but if the destination is good enough we don’t mind packing a few extra layers. I prefer the mountains, my fiancé prefers the beach. But we would both be happy anywhere! We also love coffee, museums, movies, spa days, yoga, and photography! We love animals (land or sea) so if there is an amazing aquarium or zoo I’d love to hear about it! I personally don’t mind the snow or skiing, but my Fiancé Hates it’s. So no snow skis or boards for us. 

Resorts and all inclusive places are cool and bed and breakfasts are also absolutely amazing. But we also wouldn’t mind being a little bit more secluded whether it be an Airbnb or a cabin or a house boat. Something a little bit more private on the honeymoon is always appreciated, I would imagine by both the couple and the neighbors. 😉

If a place has a honeymoon package, or if you got a honeymoon package that was awesome, I would love to hear about it and your experience! I am totally open to packages or bundling travel, but I also don’t mind doing things separate and going through multiple sites.

We’re trying not to break the bank and would prefer to keep the travel and lodging under 1200-1500 total

Road trip from Miami down the keys 
Colorado (not sure where in Colorado)
Washington (Tacoma or Seattle ?maybe?)
Oregon (maybe Portland)

I proposed in Las Vegas and we are getting married in Savannah so those two are for sure not in the running. We also thought about renting an RV and road tripping for a week but it just sounds like waaaaaaay too much driving and not enough relaxing with one another.

**Some background:**

\- The trip will probably be in April or May, as I probably won't get my passport before then.

\- Will go for probably about 2 weeks.

\- We both have jobs we can take time off for.

\- Both in our 30's and relatively good shape; don't mind some hiking.

\- While I would like to travel cheaply, budget isn't *that* much of a concern, so I'm not opposed to spending some extra if it gets something exciting. It can be assumed that all the necessary travel and lodging costs can be covered fine.

We would be 6-10 guys (18 years old) with a budget of about $1500-1800 each, and we’d like to go during the end of June or beginning of July (2021) for one week. The point of the trip would be to party as much as possible, so I need advice in quite a few things. If you are familiar with how things go in Cancún, I would really appreciate your help.

First of all, I’d like to know which all inclusive hotels (I asume all inclusives are the best choice, budget wise) in Punta Cancún have a party atmosphere with people around our age range? The way I’m currently going about it is by looking for flights + all inclusive hotel packages in expedia (if there is a better alternative to this, let me know) but I’d like to know if there are any specific hotels with a good party vibe that are within our budget. 

Second, my main questions are about the night clubs or bars. We’d like to go to a club every night if possible. So my main doubt is: should we buy the entrance tickets to these clubs online prior to going to Cancún? Or is it common to buy these tickets once we are already there? Which is the better choice?

Then, which clubs are currently best to party? Preferably places where we can stand, dance, move around, and meet girls. We are trying to avoid places that are limited to a table reservation with little movement or flexibility. We’ve looked into The City Club, Mándala Club and La Vaquita, which all look promising. But clubs like Coco Bongo and Señor Frog’s seem too stale party wise with the current restrictions (we don’t really care about shows) and with limited movement. Please let me know if I’m wrong about this and which ones would be the best choices for what we’re looking for.

My last question would be if it is preferable to book everything separated (they way I’m doing now) or if I should look for a package from a travel agency that includes flights, hotel, and club entrances for one price. If an agency is the better choice, which one is best to organize this type of party trips?

I've been to a lot of countries where it's common for loose dogs to run around in packs in the cities and even the country--Vietnam, India, Laos, Thailand--I've dealt with it but I've been attacked one too many times, and it just ruins the travel experience for me.  


I understand this is common in much of the developing world--and I want to avoid that. It's not really a problem for me in Europe or in more developed countries, and I didn't mind it in Burma or Georgia since the dogs there were fat, lazy, and generally asleep at all times, lol.  


Recently I was in Zanzibar and I don't think I saw one dog the entire time.   It was wonderful and I could walk alone down poor alleys and not have to worry about being attacked.

I'm a young woman (30), who will be quite pregnant by the time we leave and will be traveling with my husband and 2 younger children. We are very accustom to traveling around Europe by rental car and going wherever we want. We will most likely be staying within the tourist areas of western Turkey, perhaps only stopping off in smaller towns along the way for food or an lodging. Is it safe to do so and to drive ourselves around? Are there precautions we should take? Should I be concerned about being heavily pregnant (I wouldn't think so but just have to ask for my anxiety)? Our last trip in 2019 before covid hit was to Greece where we freely roamed the mainland and never felt more safe. We did have one experience driving cross country in Italy in Matera where a couple tried to intimidate and scam us, claiming to be police but were not. That shook us a bit but out of 9 countries in Europe that we've roundtripped around, that was the only negative experience we've ever had. I am absolutely fascinated by Turkey and want my children to experience it as well as this will be our first trip to the middle east. My husband is very skeptical as I'm sure you know, here in the US, the government very much tries to instill fear in its citizens when it comes to Muslim countries. I do not buy this and want to experience this beautiful county but also want to feel safe. I've read nothing but wonderful accounts from those that have been there.

Texans were enduring a lack of preparation for winter weather at a state level and seeing decades low temperatures. I purchased the flight to Vegas on Spirit and return flight on United with Chase Sapphire Reserve CC. I rescheduled the flight to 2/20 (original return scheduled date was 2/16). The airline rescheduled my flight after cancelling my return flights but my complex had pipes burst and turned off the water. Additionally, the heating system at my complex is dependent on the water supply so there was heating issues for residents (I have emails from the complex explaining this that I plan to include in my Chase insurance claim). This was in addition to record-breaking low temperatures in Houston. I didn’t want to return to also find that all grocery stores were low on vital supplies. I plan to file a benefits claim this week for Trip Delay Insurance through Chase’s website. Flights were being cancelled due to weather on 2/17 and 2/18, and I didn’t want to be stuck at the airport waiting for a return flight and having to scramble for a hotel last minute. I worked from the hotel that week and many of my coworkers were without power and water the whole week.

My questions: Should I file the claim for only the first night and include food purchases for that evening, given Chase Trip Delay insurance guidelines? I think it’s reasonable for me to explain that flying back to Texas before Saturday was a significant risk given the above points about my complex and the fact there was a major disaster declared at both state and federal level. 

Will Chase deny my claim if I try to submit 2/16-2/20 hotel stays plus meals? My concern is that Chase will deny my claim as I could have technically flown back earlier. However, I don’t think Chase would have a method to know that I could’ve returned earlier given the dire situation in Texas for many. 

$500 appears to be the maximum benefit from Trip Delay Insurance as the Trip Interruption insurance won’t cover my particular situation from how I understand the explanation of the insurance options.

\-Any booking recommendations or strategies? Or just simply book online and pay in advance?

\-How are the campground facilities (generally speaking) in both countries? What do they typically cost per night?

\-How does damage and liability insurance work? Seems CRAZY expensive on the booking websites. Have others had coverage through their credit cards or other means?

763,2021-02-22T04:57:31Z,0.0,lpkciw,t3,question,2.0,"Hey folks,

Posted this on r/volunteer and I figured I could try here as well.

So I'm in quite an emotional pickle. For the longest time I've had the urge to go abroad and help wildlife. Me and my partner both want/wanted to do this. We already volunteer locally (Both based in the Netherlands) to try and help out with maintaining the extraordinary and rare microclimate we have in the Dunes of Loon and Drunen. It's basically a desert with shifting sands, which is incredibly rare in Europe. If you want to check it out, here's a link: [https://ipanematravels.com/visit-dunes-of-loon-and-drunen-netherlands-complete-guide/](https://ipanematravels.com/visit-dunes-of-loon-and-drunen-netherlands-complete-guide/)

Either way, me and my partner are both Vegan, we sort our trash extensively, we pick up trash on the streets, in the local forest and in the Dunes I just mentioned whenever we visit outside of volunteer work. I've tried volunteering with our local Animal Ambulance in the past but that didn't really work out in the end because of organizational mismanagement. Anyway, we feel like its not enough, we want to do more.

I just graduated from my studies and got my first full time and serious job, while my partner is about to finish her Master's degree. So we thought, maybe we when she graduates, we could take a month and go volunteering with wildlife abroad. We checked some of the more popular websites, albeit with a critical note, because we know of those situations where western volunteers pay a hefty amount to do basically nothing of worth. We found some animal rehabilitation centers in Costa Rica and we felt like that would be a good choice for a first time experience, until I started reading about (wildlife) voluntourism, both the positive and the bad sides.

After reading about voluntourism we kind of gave up the dream. We don't want to take jobs from locals, we don't want to pay lots of money that isn't spent on helping the actual wildlife, we don't want to come in contact with animals if its going to harm them, we want to actually make a real impact, not a fake one. This realization left a void, since I really want to help, but I feel like I can't. We do what we can, but we want to do so much more and it creates a ton of frustration. We are not vets, we are not biologists (even though I wish I was, but my father pushed me into economics in middle school, and well...kind of late to turn around now right?) and we have no real helpful skills regarding animal care, just a very strong will to learn.

Then I found this site: [https://wildlifeact.com/blog/responsible-voluntourism-infographic/](https://wildlifeact.com/blog/responsible-voluntourism-infographic/)

Wildlife ACT is seemingly tied to organizations such as WWF and claims to use responsible voluntourism where no more than 5 volunteers are allowed on-site. There is still a hefty amount of money to be paid to join their projects, but their testimonials claim that people have had an amazing time with real professionals. Thing is, I can't see the wood for the trees anymore and I don't know if Wildlife ACT would be worth our time and money and if we would really have a non-harmful impact.

My partner changed her mind and she doesn't want to go abroad anymore because she is so distrustful of the whole situation, she doesn't want to come close to any wildlife if it doesn't help them and the thinks we would not be needed abroad, but I'm still looking for ways in which we CAN actually help without causing harm, I just don't know where to look anymore, which organization is fake, which project is harmful. I just don't know anymore. The realization that I might not be able to protect species against poaching, extinction, deforestation, even though I want to so bad, leaves me feeling very empty and hollow and I don't know what to do with it.

Does anyone know Wildlife ACT? Are they for real? Any other bright ideas? Would it maybe just be better to focus on helping out locally, like we already do, but more? Instead of going abroad, where we are maybe not needed? Does anyone know of any REAL projects regarding animal conservation, restoration of forests (e.g. planting trees etc.), prevention of deforestation, ecosystem preservation etc. where we could be helpful instead of detrimental?

I'm planning to quit my job and travel for a year - the majority of the trip I want to explore South America.

I have a question about the salt flats in Bolivia. The Salt Flats are probably the thing I'm most looking forward to seeing... they just look incredible. I definitely want to go during the rainy season to try and see the great mirror effect - probably would be thinking February or so. However, I'm a bit worried that the rainy season will mar other sights (e.g. overcast/foggy on hikes meaning you can't see views), and I know that you cant necessarily see all of the salt flats when it's too wet. 

I'm wondering if its worth trying to pop into Bolivia to do the rainy season salt flats, then go and explore elsewhere where the weather is better, (maybe Chile?) and then return to Bolivia a few months later to see the salt flats in summer and the rest of the sights.

Time isn't necessarily an issue as I'll be off for a year. I just don't know if it's worth it/if the rainy season would have a significant impact on other sights in Bolivia. I know this is just going to be on opinion/personal preference... I guess I'm hoping someone who's been to Bolivia in the rainy season will see this!

So 7 days into the Great Texas Freeze I am finally feeling normal. No we still do not have power and the water pressure is minimal, but we do have gas and a 40 gallon hot water heater. With those two things I was able to take long hot bath. It was sooo good. And it brought back some great memories of New Zealand, almost 30 years ago. 

After a weak attempt to immigrate to NZ I decided to travel the country. Hitching when I could and undertaking some great excursions. After visiting Queenstown and bungee jumping over the Shotover River I embarked on a series of hikes, tramping. The one the came to mind in the tub was a route over the Banks Track Pennisula, 3 days over about 20 miles, just outside of Christchurch. 

In setting off on the first day I realized I was the only one on that section. The sky was overcast and rain predicted, and I had about 6.5 miles to cover. The first part started off with a bit of a climb that took me to the coastline. At about the third mile I reached the rise and was able to see the cliffs and ocean. I wish I could tell you how spectacular it was but that would not quite sum it up. While approaching the coastline I could see a storm coming in from Antarctica. It was impressive and quickly realized I could be in trouble, as I was not prepared. And right on queue it bagan to snow. Knowing I still had 3 miles to go I hightailed it to the overnight hut. 

Arriving at the hut I was cold, wet, and miserable with no one to share my bitching. After unloading and scouting out the shelter I discovered a bath. This was a rare occurrence from what I had experienced up to that point. I went from pathetic to exuberant in seconds. The tub could not fill up fast enough, steam filling the room. As I lowered himself into the  water, so hot that it hurt, I immediately let out the biggest sigh. I would spend about 2 hours soaking and drinking the wine I had brought for the 3 days. Why because I was the only one there for the night. 

The next day was a beautiful day that took me to another hut with an outdoor tub and a view of penguins. Needless to see soaking under the stars in the presence of nature was glorious.",travel,Snowy Travels in New Zealand Story,6.0,0.87

But I'm worried for my safety.


Iran has overall a bad reputation. A lot of people think it's only a terrorist warzone. But apparently some travelers and some sites like WikiVoyage and other traveling sites say it's relatively safe in the last few years.


 But yet my friends and family don't want me to ever visit there.


And interestingly enough, I've searched more on the Internet and when searching in French, most websites say it's not safe and they discourage any travel. Which is the complete opposite of what I search in English. So what's the truth? Is it safe or not? Maybe it's way less safe for French citizens? But the Iranian govn't (and people because of propaganda) have a way bigger problem with the US than with France, so it still doesn't explain why the results are so different.


And yeah please don't talk about corona... I don't have the money anyway and I'm not gonna travel anywhere far enough while the pandemic is still here, I just want to know, other than the pandemic, is it safe, are there a risk of terrorism and kidnapping? I only theorise to visit there in several years maybe... 


And please tell me how sage it is relative to other countries. I've visited some countries that might be unsafe in some places. (I also have the Belarusian passport). I've visited Ukraine, but where there's no war / civil war. I've so visited Israel. So maybe Iran is like those 2, if you don't go in the shitty zones it's safe?

On a semi related note, if checking luggage, buy 4 wheeled if you can, less likely baggage handler will ""toss"" the bag, will roll whenever possible. Better quality fabric is better than hard plastics, for instance, the tumis have a canvas exterior, but a sturdy skeleton in the bag, this is why they hold up well

Poor quality bags have a rigid skeleton that eventually breaks or is made of poor quality cloth that tears. I haven't seen a brand of hard plastic luggage that has lasted, always some spot that is broken except maybe the Pelican waterproof cases, but at that point its a case and not luggage.

Zippers. Cheap zippers will eventually leave you with your clothing in the belly of a 737 scattered everywhere, and the baggage handler will try and scoop it up and place it back into the bag, but at that point your clothes could smell like fish/dog urine/anything in that cargo hold that smells, or covered in a light dusting of the aluminum floors that get rubbed off during all of the friction of loading and unloading cargo and baggage.

Saran wrap/cling wrap/platic We hate this crap. We know at some locations its necessary, but pleases please please for your bags sake and our backs, leave the wheels available for use, and please have a 4 wheeled bag. The plastic prevents the bag to be slid across smooth surfaces and must be tossed/thrown/slung to be loaded into the cargo hold

Locks Use a tsa lock on your zippers, it won't completely thwart theft, but it might prevent the zippers from catching something, coming apart and have contents visible or come out of the bag DO NOT USE ZIP TIES or LOCKS in the event that you have zip ties or non tsa locks and tsa has to get in your bags, they will not cut the zips or locks until they can contact you, possibly leaving the bag off the flight. Occasionally, airline supervisor will allow them to cut the lock so that the bag will make the flight, but you will not get reimbursed for the lock.

Do not over stuff your bags! 9/10 these are the bags that get to baggage claim completely exploded, cheap zippers, crappy quality fabric and overstuffed bag is just a ticking time bomb for all of your belonging to go flying everywhere.

Don't pack things in the front zipper of your bag, maybe if it's flat its ok. The items create a bulge on the front of the bag and quickly becomes a point for the bag to get caught on different surfaces, usually causing the whole front zippered pocket to tear open

NEVER pack your keys or medicine in THE CHECKED bags. self explanatory

Wow tldr. Buy good 4 wheeled luggage, don't over stuff bags. Don't pack important things in checked bags. Don't use front pocket.

Flights and resort have already been booked but I have no idea how to actually plan a trip. I'm from the Midwestern united States and have only left my region once that I can remember and absolutely loved it (Went to new jersey and new york).

I dont even know how to make those things happen so advice on that would be great. I know these things are on the south side of the island and we will be staying on the north so how do we even get there? 

I do have thalassophobia so doing something that would isolate us in a body of water would like cause a panic attack so id prefer to avoid that but doing short boat trips to different places around the island arent completely out of the picture. If I can see a shore then ill likely be fine.

As I checked in, I joked with ground staff, ""I hope no one takes my R2D2 bag tag, haha."" Well, I arrived with light rain in Stockholm with no bag. I had what I had on me, and 1 pair of boxers in my carry on. 

3 weeks in Europe, and I would find my bag would never get back to me. I had baggage insurance, and since it was lost, I was compensated fairly by the airline (took forever), and insurance (with no issue), and even my expenses. I learned my lesson and packed differently now, always get travel insurance, the whole shebang. When I got back I was pretty sad, since all of my favorite things were in there since I was gone for a little bit. I was actually able to replace my shoes after finding them on eBay. I was mad since I stopped in Amsterdam, some dude was rocking my look and wearing all my stuff, whatever. 

2 days ago, I got a voicemail from a hotel reception in Stockholm from a hotel at saying ""hello I'm calling because we have something of yours, and we'd like to return it, call us back."" Uh, what? I haven't been there in a while. I do remember leaving a toiletries bag, but was it there? Anyway, I call. They have my bag! FROM 2018! I couldn't believe it. I explained what happened, and the receptionist is shocked, laughing, it was crazy. The crazier thing is, I didn't even stay there. I asked for some photos to verify it's my bag, and sure enough R2 made it. I see the bag tag that was added (presumably after it was located from being lost), was addressed to this hotel, with someone else's name on it. So there was my mystery after all this time, they just didn't ship it to the right place. Anyway, I couldn't get an answer when it arrived, but really it didn't matter. Either the hotel or airport cleaned out some storage and found it. 

The hotel said I should do a waybill and have like someone come pick it up. I reached out to the airline, they flatly said they will not help. So here I am. I want to get reunited with my bag, but I'm looking at FedEx rates of $500. Has anyone ever used a 3rd party service for bags? I imagine it might be an issue since I am not the one sending it off.

As a result, our pipes in our home burst on February 17th.  At this point, we could no longer attempt to make the trip as our house is no longer habitable.  Reluctantly, we canceled our reservations and were issued refunds by all parties except this corporation which refused to offer any recompense for any portion of the 8 day stay we booked due to their cancellation policy, which we missed by a matter of days.  We spoke to management on 3 different occasions and were not offered even an attempt at empathy for our situation much less any willingness to help with any portion of the $6,000 cost for the 8 day stay.

* I also looked into Sedona or Scottsdale, AZ but it looks like there are a lot of restrictions there too.

1. Turbulence: How normal is turbulence (even if it’s a significant amount) and can it harm the plane? Can a plane crash or wing become damaged because of all the shaking? 

2. Shift in engine sounds: I noticed a couple times throughout the flight it sounded like the engine was slowing down and/or speeding up. Is this normal? Should I be alarmed if I hear a decrease in engine / plane sounds?

3. What happens if a plane part is faulty? For example, what if the engine stops running or a part falls off? Is this even possible? Are there backups? How thorough is inspection?

I have been living in Mexico for several months with my girlfriend. Since she couldn't come to the US, we decided to meet in Mexico. Overall our experiences have been good but we have had quite a few bad experiences and I'm afraid to say that they have left a really bad taste in my mouth and I'm not sure if I will come back.

The positives:

1. The food is AMAZING! I love spicy food and I like that I can get anything here spicy. Each region has a different cuisine and you really never get bored with it.

2. People are really nice and helpful. I was picking out some tequila in a store and another customer came over and was giving me suggestions as to what to buy and what to avoid. This has also happened in restaurants that had food I was unfamiliar with. Genuinely nice people who are wanting to help foreigners without anything expected in return.

3. There is so much to explore here. On just about every street corner there is a cool shop selling unique items. Beautiful cathedrals, streets that look like Spain, and plenty of greenery.

4. It's very affordable (exception: touristy areas like Cancun). A fancy meal here costs no more than $15 per person.

But unfortunately I have had so many negative experiences here that it has left a really bad taste in my mouth:

This one is trivial, but it's really difficult to eat healthy here. Almost everything is loaded with sugar, carbs, meat, or processed chemicals. Finding healthy things like salads can be very challenging. Most grocery stores and markets do not carry any vegetables other than onions, tomatoes, and cilantro which are mostly used as toppings for tacos or soups.

1. Racism and discrimination. Because my girlfriend and I have white skin, everyone assumes we have money so we get all the attention from panhandlers, scammers, and beggars. What they don't know is that my girlfriend is from Ukraine and had to flee from Donetsk during the fighting. She probably has less money than most people in Mexico City. The worst incident was in a restaurant with some mariachis. One guy came over to our table and interrupted our dinner and insisted that because we were gringos, we have money and can fork over 1000 pesos for the mariachis to play another round of songs.

2. Everywhere you go, someone is trying to sell you something. After the 10th guy asks you about a tour of the city, you just really want to be left alone. Some people are really pushy and will follow you around even if you say no. People trying to sell you drugs or fake items are also common. If you ever go to the Cancun area, they start trying to sell you stuff the minute you land at the airport and up until you get to your destination.

3. Price scams. I've been to several restaurants where we were charged more than the price on the menu. When you call them out on it, they play dumb or say something like ""sorry, the menu has the old prices"" or just say it was an honest mistake. Also, many taxis don't have meters here and instead rely on a zone system. Probably 25% of the taxis I've been in have tried to overcharge me significantly. When you call the driver out on it, he makes excuses or says the zone is different, even though I've gotten a taxi from the same place to the same destination a dozen times and always paid the same amount.

4. So many liars. People here are very nice, but you have to be really careful because they will lie straight to your face while being nice about it. It gets to the point where you aren't sure if someone is being genuinely nice or trying to scam. My GF from Ukraine doesn't speak to anyone because of the Eastern European mentality. Examples: I went to a juice shop and asked the guy if it's 100% juice. He said yes, but I saw a worker in the back making juice and was dumping water in it. At a market I was looking at some honey and asked about the quality and type. The lady said it was 100% pure and good quality. I was going to buy some but then I noticed that the bucket that she was filling the jars from had the ingredients listed and the honey was not 100% pure and instead had glucose syrup mixed in. When I asked her about it, she played dumb and said she didn't know, but that the honey is still good quality.

5. My girlfriend has been whistled at, stared at, and had faces made at her from gross men. The worst was a guy who was sticking his tongue out making a licking expression and saying nasty things.

6. My phone was stolen by a guy on a motorbike. I was on a corner close to a building responding to an email when someone on a motorbike hopped the curb, grabbed my phone, and took off. Just being in the wrong place at the wrong time I suppose. Thankfully it was an iPhone 7 and not worth a lot but is what made the situation worse is that the police laughed at me when I wanted to file a report.",travel,Any countries you won't return to due to negative experiences?,0.0,0.42

At first sleeping on the couch sucked more than the second floor neighbors pounding their feet all night. After awhile though I embraced the couch life and went with it. This mind set has brought me to the wildest places and the strangest couches. I’ve found myself on many a couches and every one has a story. Once an average night out with a few friends turned into a late night gambling adventure that brought me to the queen suite of the casino. There were 4 of us and you guessed it I got the couch. Waking up the next morning was so uncomfortable but the view from the room over the city was amazing. More than once I’ve made my way to the Irish lads house where in the morning I was sure to get a cup of tea and the continued laughter from the night before. A few times I’ve woken up in a basement apartment with Harley Davidson motorcycles as my alarm clock. Although it seems all fun, the life of couch surfing can take its tole. Cold nights with no blankets, knots in my back from sleeping on the occasional TV remote and a crooked neck from the couch arm rest. I never planned on being a couch surfer but I also wouldn’t wish I hadn’t gone through it. It’s eye opening and adventurous, it’s harsh and unforgiving, it’s extreme.

I was supposed to go on a big trip for my 30th birthday in Jan, but it's been rescheduled for obvious reasons.  Since it's been gross and grey where I live, I'm trying to distract myself by planning my rescheduled trip and would like some suggestions because I know nothing about Germany.  Here are the details I have so far, pandemic, vaccines, and vacation-days permitting.

Trip Length: A week in Germany, 1-3 days in Brussels (my sister wants to see a friend)

Travelers: two women, 30 and 33.

Timeframe: Hopefully in early September.

Cities we want to see: Ok, so other than Berlin, I have no idea what to even look for.

Activities we want to do: I'd like to go hiking and see Neuschwanstein Castle.  We may want to do a tour to Auschwitz because I think it's an important thing for us to see, but it also might mess me up for a while if I don't balance it with something peaceful (like a hike).  I'm not a huge museum person, but might be interested if it's a unique museum (i.e., not an art museum, but science and tech museum or an animation museum).  Also, I saw there was a chocolate museum, so that's going to happen if we can fit it in.

Why the heck I chose Germany if I don't know what to see, don't eat meat, and don't drink: my sister and I spent 30 minutes trying to find a country we could both agree on that neither one had been to before.  We ended up settling on Denmark or Germany, and went with Germany because it seemed easier to get around in.

Do you have any tours you've booked in Germany that you enjoyed?  Or hotels you can recommend?  Any restaurant or food recs for a vegetarian in Germany?  I think we're going to get an apartment/hotel with a kitchenette at least so we can cook some meals in.  We won't be driving in Germany.  I haven't really driven in 7 years and I don't think I have the confidence to just rent a car there, unfortunately.  We'll be relying on public transport, taxis, and Uber/Lyft/rideshares (if available).    

Here's the loose itinerary I've put together so far:

Day 0: Fly to Munich, arrive around noon in Munich.  Get to hotel, get settled, and go for a walk to deal with jetlag (West Park or English Park?)

Day 1: Munich-ish Day?

* Residenz
* Deutsches Museum
* Museum of Transportation

Day 2: Neuschwanstein Castle (hiking and castle)

Day 3: Dachau and potentially finding a climbing gym in the afternoon

Day 4: Salzburg

Day 5: 

Day 6: Romantic Road, Rothenburg, and Harburg tour? 

Day 7:Fly to Brussels 

Day 8:

Day 9: 

Day 10: Fly back to the US

Sorry for the cringey language. Still, wanted to ask you (the Americans) some questions (i'll give you some background). Feel free to only respond to the ones you can/want

1. What should my itinerary be? (broad question, keep in mind I'd just like to see the major cities as well as the best national parks spots and the trip should last 25 days to a month max. I'd be stopping in one place for 3-4 days max, I like to visit museums so ones such as Smithsonian/Guggenheim/MoMA are a must. On top of that I HAVE to go through Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks, matter of personal interest. The trip i thought i could take (very broad) was the northern route from NY to LA and back through the southern rote coming back. Last on this subject: the cities I would like to visit most are: NY city (i'd stay there some time), Washington DC (mainly fo the Smithsonian), LA, San Francisco, maybe Miami, maybe Vegas. Some other places i'd like to go through: Utah salt flats, Alabama and West Virginia (yes for the photos with the signs), some desert landscape (not much where i live) and some more northern state (so I see a bit of everything). 
2. How should I get a car? The obvious one would be to rent it (as much as I'd like to rent a vintage Mustang I don't need it/would probably cost too much so a Fiesta sized one will do just fine) but I thought to myself if just buying an old camry or corolla (or similar) wouldn't be cheaper. I'm not afraid to go through the hassle of buying and registering a car but the process is quite different from here in the EU so I'd have to look into it. If you think renting a car is better, where from? Are they all almost the same thing or is there a rental company that you think delivers best for the money or way better than the others for not much more?
3. Where should I stay? So, I really don't have high standards for where to sleep while travelling (my philosophy is spend little on accomodation so you have more for activities and things to do, places to see). I'd be willing (and wanting) to do quite some camping for most of the trip (not when I'm in cities obv) but Idk about the legality of it in the wild in the US (on the subject, things I have to be afraid of while camping). If you have better ideas (idk anything about motels but if you reckon they're a good option I'll consider them). In the cities I'll be staying in airbnbs (hate hotels).
4. Things I have to eat? What you think (don't argue too much plz) are the best places to eat at? (fast food but also special meals you can only get in one place) I'll spend a little bit more for a really good meal but also not Nobu please.
5. Places that aren't famous but you think would deserve it? (Mainly natural landscapes but also towns/cities that have something special or a particular history or museums that not many people know about) (btw is there a museum in Los Alamos?)
6. Legality of alcohol and recreational marijuana. My username ends in 420, not a coincidence. On a serious note, I like to have a beer from time to time and by the time I do this trip I'll probably be 21 so that shouldn't be an issue (btw how much can you drink if you drive (what is the alcohol concentration limit))? In which states can I buy weed, what age do I have to be and where can i consume it (especially as a foreigner)?
7. Things that people don't consider before doing a US roadtrip but they really should know.

If you need to change ANYTHING about your reservation at any point after making it, you will likely forfeit the entire amount of the booking. Even bookings that claim to be refundable will be subject to the approval of a mystery ""travel partner"". You are not allowed to know anything about this travel partner including contact or reasoning for their refund decisions. Even if the actual hotel you are booking accommodates changes/refunds, the ""travel partner"" will block the refund. So the hotel won't get the money and you won't get the money.

It seems especially important now that travel companies have ethical practices that reflect our changing world - snaptravel has chosen to respond to this need by profiting off inevitable changes in travel.

Looking online for carry-on luggage, every single carry-on case I can find is larger than those dimensions in some way or another. Maybe 22x14.25x9.5 or something similar where the actual dimensions are quarters/halves of an inch too large.

I checked reviews to see if maybe people were mentioning ""says it's too large but it fits in 22x14x9 bins"" or something like that, but nearly every review is always like ""looks nice, feels nice, has room for things"" with little to no useful information.

I looked at Samsonite, all too big or exorbitantly expensive *and* too big, looked at budget brands also all too big.

If every carry-on is slightly too large then I guess that means it's okay to go over the size by fractions of an inch? I see more people flying with carry-on bags than without so surely there are lots of them out there.

Update: If anyone else is concerned about this as a first-time carry-on bringer, the size specifics really don't matter. You can bring a suitcase slightly too big or even over an inch too big and probably be fine. As long as it fits in the overhead compartment, no one will even care. I got a carry-on slightly smaller than the 22x14x9 guidance and there was still a huge amount of clearance in the overhead compartment for all dimensions.

I haven't seen anyone get their carry-on measured before either, so despite how strict it sounds online to be within those measurements it probably won't be checked. Reading online makes it sound as if a bag won't fit at all outside of those dimensions, but that's not true.",travel,Trying to find a 22x14x9 carry-on bag is seemingly impossible,3.0,0.67

Originally we wanted to leave the country, but given the pandemic this probably isn't a good idea. Similarly because of the pandemic, we now think it would be best to do a mostly scenic/ nature trip. We're from the Midwest and have seen enough of this side of the country, so we're thinking a big western trip. 

As of now we have our eyes on California. Also, given that we'd be traveling in the middle of the summer, we think northern California would be most ideal. Here's our current plan:

**Plan/ Itinerary**

\-Day 1-2: Arrive in SF, explore the city

\-Day 3-5: Drive to Monterey (or Carmel?), use that area as our home base for these days. Explore Monterey/ Carmel, and spend 1-2 of the days driving down HWY 1 to Big Sur and perhaps camping there. 

\-Day 6-8: Drive to, stay in Yosemite

* Day 6: Drive to Yosemite from Monterey, taking a slightly longer drive so that we come in via Highway 41, seeing Tunnel View on the way in. Figure out and set up our camping spot in Yosemite valley, and explore the valley (will be reserving a campsite). 
* Day 7: Drive out of the valley and spend the whole day driving through the Sierras via Highway 120, stopping at misc. sites such as the Tuolumne Meadows. Maybe make it to Mono Lake and explore that area? Drive back to camp once it gets dark.
* Day 8: Free day - explore, see whatever else we want to see during our final day in Yosemite.

\-Day 9: Leave Yosemite, drive back to SF, stopping at a Napa/Sonoma winery shortly before sunset. Go back to SF for our final night before flying out the next day. 

\-Day 10: Fly home early.

**Questions (not as urgent questions are italicized)**

1. How does this itinerary sound? Would I be rushed? I want to be relaxing, not stressed. Would I be fully experiencing each of these different areas/ spending enough time in them? 
2. Our budget is around $2,000 each, definitely no more than $2,500. Will we be able to afford this, while still being able to eat at restaurants fairly often and doing a few paid activities/ buying a couple souvenirs? Also, there is no time restriction - could we potentially make this a longer trip while still staying in budget? 
3. Big Sur is currently closed, and staying in Yosemite valley might not be the most ideal during a pandemic (which may be not as bad by this summer?). Should I be choosing a different trip given these two concerns? 
4. *Does anyone have recommendations for places to stop along Highway 120/ in the eastern Sierras?* 
5. *Would it be worth it trying to fit a day or two in Lake Tahoe? Any other places close by we should consider?* 
6. Are there prettier/ cooler trips we could be doing than Northern California? I've briefly thought about Colorado/ the Rocky Mountains, or more north of California (Oregon? Maybe start in Seattle and drive down to SF?). I would be down for a longer road trip across multiple states, too. Basically, I want to see the most beautiful nature that the USA has to offer.

Is there anywhere you would recommend en route, or changes to the itinerary if we do in fact have four full days from this trip... ? Maybe the night and bit of the morning in San Antonio instead of Bandera? Thanks!!",travel,"Texas roadtrip: Bandera Marfa, Big Bed, Austin",3.0,0.71

I want to not only be responsible with my travels but want to be welcomed as well, not scoffed at for travelling when I shouldn't be. This is simply planning for if we get vaccinated as we plan to shortly and things begin opening up and welcoming travelers come summer or early fall.

My wife and I are in the planning stages for a Switzerland trip, we'd love to see and hike the alps. This region has been very confusing as I'm looking into how to get around and I just wanted to run a few questions by you guys to get me pointed in the right direction.

Our rough outline would be fly into Zurich, spend 2 days in Lucerne, continue on to the Jungfrau region where we would spend the remaining 6 additional days for a roughly 8 or 9 day trip. Fly out of Zurich.

The first question is outside of the Jungfrau area, what do you think of Lucerne as a 2 day base to get a little bit of the city feel? What are some other top contender areas to stay in?

Second, once inside Jungfrau, which small town would you recommend to stay in? It's important to us to have an area to explore while not out hiking so super small town doesn't sound right, also probably the most important point is that it's well connected to the towns around it so we could spend our 6 days hopping from town to town view train/cable car, they seem to have a great transit system set up, it's just tough to determine which one would be a good central location to use as a home base. My best guess on this one seems to be Wengen from what I've read thusfar.

Lastly, With the costs of the trains running up with all the hopping between towns it seems like buying a travel pass would be helpful, from what I'm reading the swiss pass seems like the most all encompassing option, but it's difficult to find if there's anything left out. Does it only cover some regions? questions like that come up. It said it only covers 50% of cable cars as well, with the last question in mind about where to stay what train pass would you guys recommend and would staying in a particular town lower the amount of cable cars we would end up using?

Thanks in advance you guys have always been very welcoming and helpful!",travel,Switzerland 2021 hopefully,5.0,0.7

\- Arrive in Zagreb by plane (stay about 4-6 days)  
\- Take a day trip to Ljubljana, Bled (Slovenia) during our stay in Zagreb to see a few sites  
\- Travel to Plitvice Lakes on our way to the next city (Split)  
\- Stay in Split for about 4-6 days   
\- Take a day trip to Mostar (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina)  
\- Stay in Dubrovnik for a few days then fly back home from there  


I'm not sure if the trip to Mostar would be best from Split or Dubrovnik, and I have found a few tour guided trips to Mostar from each city, so hopefully that makes the border crossing easier. I hear crossing borders to neighboring countries can be quite difficult if renting a car as well as finding parking in cities. The uber rates I saw seemed reasonable for the distances between the cities for our Croatian travel plans, but I dont think taking an Uber to every location in our plans is the best option.   


Does anybody here have recommendations for travel between the locations listed? If I can rent cars for just a day at a time just to travel to each location that could work but I'm not sure how much of a hassle that can be.

It's now 2021, and while vaccines are starting to be administered in several countries, the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation continues to have a major effect on travel, with many now looking to understand if, when, or how their travels might be feasible. Accordingly, /r/travel is continue its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates.

In the interest of reducing the number of one-off questions, **before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans, consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following:**

## Are borders open? What entry or transit restrictions are in place? Will I need to quarantine?

A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources, including from [IATA](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm), [Kayak's travel restriction map](https://www.kayak.com/travel-restrictions), or [this alternative site](https://covidtravelrestrictions.com/) that draws information from IATA. Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air (so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures).

You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country (and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country). **Because information can change on short notice, it is important to verify the latest information, ideally from government sources.**

## ...in the US?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in or transited via Brazil, China, Iran, Ireland, the Schengen Area, or the UK in the preceding 14 days. Starting Jan. 30, foreign nationals will be prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in or transited via South Africa in the preceding 14 days. Exceptions to this rule include green card holders. *Note that (except for, of course, US citizens) this is not a citizenship-based restriction; it is purely based on travel history.*

All air passengers (including US citizens and green card holders), regardless of origin and nationality, [need to produce a negative result](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html) from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US. 

The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes, but [air, rail, and sea (but not commuter rail or ferry) ports-of-entry remain open](https://ca.usembassy.gov/travel-restrictions-fact-sheet/) to non-essential travel.

No nationwide quarantine requirements exist, although an executive order signed on Jan. 21 hinted at the possibility of one being instituted, should the CDC recommend it. Nevertheless, individual states and/or cities may have their own requirements, even for domestic travel, so you will need to confirm with information from your destination state or city. As an example, [this is New York State's travel advisory/quarantine page](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory); note that *travelers are permitted to break quarantine to leave New York State and the state's quarantine restrictions would not prevent you from boarding a connecting flight*.

For more information, see [the US CDC's COVID-19 page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).

## ...in Canada?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain, mostly essential reasons, *regardless of mode of travel*. Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions. Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for non-essential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents. Note that Canadian airlines will be halting flights to Mexico and the Caribbean. Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Fully airside international transits are typically permitted.

All passengers five years or older arriving into Canada by air will also need to produce a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to boarding. Passengers will soon be required to quarantine at hotels for at least three days, pending negative test results, in one of four cities – Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal – that will serve as the only ports-of-entry by air. After being permitted to exit hotel quarantine, which is expected to cost approx. C$2000 per passenger, travelers must continue to self-quarantine until 14 days after arrival.

For more information, see [the Canadian government's COVID-19 travel restrictions page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/travel-restrictions-exemptions.html).

## ...in Mexico?

At the time of writing, there are no changes to Mexico's standard entry requirements. However, the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes. Travelers must fill out a ""Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers"", available here, to present upon arrival. There are no quarantine requirements upon arrival in Mexico.

For more information, see information provided by Mexican embassies, including the [Mexican Embassy in the Netherlands](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/paisesbajos/index.php/foreign-nationals/frequent-questions).

## ...in the UK?

At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are barred from entering the UK if they have entered or transited South America, Panama, the UAE, or several countries in southern Africa within the previous 10 days are not permitted to enter the UK. The [full ""red list"" of countries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19#travel-bans-to-the-uk---banned-countries) is subject to change. Irish citizens and those with UK resident permits are, in addition to UK nationals, exempted from this restriction, although a requirement to quarantine in a hotel upon arrival is forthcoming.

All international arrivals (including UK citizens) will need to quarantine for 10 days after arrival. However, the quarantine period can be shortened further in England if you [test negative](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel) at least 5 days into the quarantine period. Note that, even if one is required to quarantine, one is typically permitted to leave the UK to continue their travels before their 10-day quarantine period is complete. Those coming from the countries and regions mentioned in the previous paragraph are also not eligible to participate in the test-to-release scheme.

All travelers destined for Scotland from outside the Common Travel Area [must produce a negative result](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-health-checks-at-borders/) from a test taken within three days of departure. A [similar requirement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england) also applies to those destined or transiting through England.

With ""lockdown"" measures in place within the UK, there may be restrictions on travel purposes to, from, or within the constituent countries. For example, [travel to and from Scotland is prohibited](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-travel-and-transport/) except for limited purposes.

For more information, see [UK Border Control](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control).

## ...in the EU? In the Schengen Area?

In late June, the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to short-term visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus. This [list has been updated](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic_en#restrictions-on-travel-to-the-eu), as of Dec. 16, to consist of Australia, China (subject to confirmation of reciprocity), Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. This list, however, is non-binding among member countries and is subject to change.

Nevertheless, several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance, permitting arrivals from these countries as well as ""EU+"" countries (which includes EU and Schengen countries as well as the UK). These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history and/or residency; consult resources from your destination country. However, multiple EU countries have temporarily placed additional restrictions on travel from the UK. Fully airside non-Schengen to non-Schengen transits are typically permitted, but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation (which may, at times, include negative test results) is required.

As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to third-country nationals in various ways and with different exceptions, it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their ports-of-entry. A summary of travel restrictions is [provided by the European Union](https://reopen.europa.eu/en), but many have reported that government (e.g. embassy or foreign ministry) resources have been more detailed and accurate.

## ...in South Korea?

At the time of writing, [most nationalities](http://viewer.moj.go.kr/skin/doc.html?rs=/result/bbs/229&amp;fn=temp_1586503947805100) with visa-free or visa-waiver arrangements with Korea have had their visa-free/waiver status suspended, primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens. There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China.

International arrivals, with very few exceptions, will be required to quarantine for 14 days; non-residents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense.

For more information, see the [Korea Immigration Service](http://www.immigration.go.kr/immigration_eng/index.do).

## ...in Japan?

At the time of writing, foreign nationals who have been in one of 150+ countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan. Further, visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended. Permanent residents, long-term residents, and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions.

Those individuals, including Japanese citizens, that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine. Starting Jan. 13, all travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan. Additional restrictions are in place for those travelling from the UK or South Africa.

For more information, see the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html).

## When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted? Is it safe/a good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead?

It is, of course, impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country. Where no news has been officially provided, it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures (e.g. economic or social).

Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable. Even with the vaccine rollouts, it's unclear how this will affect travel restrictions and procedures. In the meantime, with the resurgences of cases in several countries, the new variant announced in December, and the onset of the Northern Hemisphere winter, some countries have firmed up travel restrictions, requiring additional tests or quarantine periods or preventing travel from certain locations. Further, even if you are ultimately able to travel to your destination, there may be ""lockdowns"" or widespread closures of businesses and places of interest.

Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel, or even will remain as liberal as they are in your destination today. With this unprecedented situation, old adages about when it's best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid. In any event, be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits and/or refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel.

Further, understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund, even if legally required. Many travelers have reported waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund. And be aware that if your airline goes out of business, your funds could be lost forever.

Take note of your jurisdiction's laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights. For example:

* [US Dept of Transportation: Refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds)
* [EU: Air passenger rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm)

## So should I cancel a trip that I've already booked? And how? Will insurance help?

These questions were covered at length in the [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fjhjoz/coronavirus_megathread_for_travelrelated/). Although countries may be starting to ""reopen"", the points therein are still relevant.
